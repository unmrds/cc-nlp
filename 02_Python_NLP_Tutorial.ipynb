HIGGINSON\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPREFACE.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe verses of Emily Dickinson belong emphatically to what Emerson\\r\\nlong since called \"the Poetry of the Portfolio,\"--something produced\\r\\nabsolutely without the thought of publication, and solely by way of\\r\\nexpression of the writer\\'s own mind. Such verse must inevitably\\r\\nforfeit whatever advantage lies in the discipline of public criticism\\r\\nand the enforced conformity to accepted ways. On the other hand, it\\r\\nmay often gain something through the habit of freedom and the\\r\\nunconventional utterance of daring thoughts. In the case of the\\r\\npresent author, there was absolutely no choice in the matter; she\\r\\nmust write thus, or not at all. A recluse by temperament and habit,\\r\\nliterally spending years without setting her foot beyond the\\r\\ndoorstep, and many more years during which her walks were strictly\\r\\nlimited to her father\\'s grounds, she habitually concealed her mind,\\r\\nlike her person, from all but a very few friends; and it was with\\r\\ngreat difficulty that she was persuaded to print, during her\\r\\nlifetime, three or four poems.  Yet she wrote verses in great\\r\\nabundance; and though brought curiously indifferent to all\\r\\nconventional rules, had yet a rigorous literary standard of her own,\\r\\nand often altered a word many times to suit an ear which had its own\\r\\ntenacious fastidiousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Dickinson was born in Amherst, Mass., Dec. 10, 1830, and died\\r\\nthere May 15, 1886. Her father, Hon. Edward Dickinson, was the\\r\\nleading lawyer of Amherst, and was treasurer of the well-known\\r\\ncollege there situated. It was his custom once a year to hold a large\\r\\nreception at his house, attended by all the families connected with\\r\\nthe institution and by the leading people of the town. On these\\r\\noccasions his daughter Emily emerged from her wonted retirement and\\r\\ndid her part as gracious hostess; nor would any one have known from\\r\\nher manner, I have been told, that this was not a daily occurrence.\\r\\nThe annual occasion once past, she withdrew again into her seclusion,\\r\\nand except for a very few friends was as invisible to the world as if\\r\\nshe had dwelt in a nunnery.  For myself, although I had corresponded\\r\\nwith her for many years, I saw her but twice face to face, and\\r\\nbrought away the impression of something as unique and remote as\\r\\nUndine or Mignon or Thekla.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis selection from her poems is published to meet the desire of her\\r\\npersonal friends, and especially of her surviving sister. It is\\r\\nbelieved that the thoughtful reader will find in these pages a\\r\\nquality more suggestive of the poetry of William Blake than of\\r\\nanything to be elsewhere found,--flashes of wholly original and\\r\\nprofound insight into nature and life; words and phrases exhibiting\\r\\nan extraordinary vividness of descriptive and imaginative power, yet\\r\\noften set in a seemingly whimsical or even rugged frame. They are\\r\\nhere published as they were written, with very few and superficial\\r\\nchanges; although it is fair to say that the titles have been\\r\\nassigned, almost invariably, by the editors. In many cases these\\r\\nverses will seem to the reader like poetry torn up by the roots, with\\r\\nrain and dew and earth still clinging to them, giving a freshness and\\r\\na fragrance not otherwise to be conveyed.  In other cases, as in the\\r\\nfew poems of shipwreck or of mental conflict, we can only wonder at\\r\\nthe gift of vivid imagination by which this recluse woman can\\r\\ndelineate, by a few touches, the very crises of physical or mental\\r\\nstruggle. And sometimes again we catch glimpses of a lyric strain,\\r\\nsustained perhaps but for a line or two at a time, and making the\\r\\nreader regret its sudden cessation. But the main quality of these\\r\\npoems is that of extraordinary grasp and insight, uttered with an\\r\\nuneven vigor sometimes exasperating, seemingly wayward, but really\\r\\nunsought and inevitable.  After all, when a thought takes one\\'s\\r\\nbreath away, a lesson on grammar seems an impertinence. As Ruskin\\r\\nwrote in his earlier and better days, \"No weight nor mass nor beauty\\r\\nof execution can outweigh one grain or fragment of thought.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n            ---Thomas Wentworth Higginson\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTRANSCRIBER\\'S NOTE\\r\\n\\r\\nAs is well documented, Emily Dickinson\\'s poems were edited in these\\r\\nearly editions by her friends, better to fit the conventions of the\\r\\ntimes. In particular, her dashes, often small enough to appear\\r\\nas dots, became commas and semi-colons.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second series of poems published, a facsimile of her\\r\\nhandwritten poem which her editors titled \"Renunciation\" is given,\\r\\nand I here transcribe that manuscript as faithfully as I can,\\r\\nshowing _underlined_ words thus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere came a day - at Summer\\'s full -\\r\\nEntirely for me -\\r\\nI thought that such were for the Saints -\\r\\nWhere Resurrections - be -\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun - as common - went abroad -\\r\\nThe flowers - accustomed - blew,\\r\\nAs if no soul - that solstice passed -\\r\\nWhich maketh all things - new -\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time was scarce profaned - by speech -\\r\\nThe falling of a word\\r\\nWas needless - as at Sacrament -\\r\\nThe _Wardrobe_ - of our Lord!\\r\\n\\r\\nEach was to each - the sealed church -\\r\\nPermitted to commune -  _this_ time -\\r\\nLest we too awkward show\\r\\nAt Supper of \"the Lamb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hours slid fast - as hours will -\\r\\nClutched tight - by greedy hands -\\r\\nSo - faces on two Decks look back -\\r\\nBound to _opposing_ lands.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, when all the time had leaked,\\r\\nWithout external sound,\\r\\nEach bound the other\\'s Crucifix -\\r\\nWe gave no other bond -\\r\\n\\r\\nSufficient troth - that we shall _rise_,\\r\\nDeposed - at length the Grave -\\r\\nTo that new marriage -\\r\\n_Justified_ - through Calvaries - of Love!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the handwriting, it is not always clear which are dashes,\\r\\nwhich are commas and which are periods, nor it is entirely\\r\\nclear which initial letters are capitalized.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, this transcription may be compared with the edited\\r\\nversion in the main text to get a flavor of the changes made\\r\\nin these early editions.\\r\\n\\r\\n      ---JT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    This is my letter to the world,\\r\\n       That never wrote to me, --\\r\\n    The simple news that Nature told,\\r\\n       With tender majesty.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Her message is committed\\r\\n       To hands I cannot see;\\r\\n    For love of her, sweet countrymen,\\r\\n       Judge tenderly of me!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI.

me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wizard-fingers never rest,\\r\\nThe purple brook within the breast\\r\\nStill chafes its narrow bed;\\r\\n\\r\\nStill rears the East her amber flag,\\r\\nGuides still the sun along the crag\\r\\nHis caravan of red,\\r\\n\\r\\nLike flowers that heard the tale of dews,\\r\\nBut never deemed the dripping prize\\r\\nAwaited their low brows;\\r\\n\\r\\nOr bees, that thought the

sturdy little countenance\\r\\nAgainst the wind is seen,\\r\\n\\r\\nContending with the grass,\\r\\nNear kinsman to herself,\\r\\nFor privilege of sod and sun,\\r\\nSweet litigants for life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when the hills are full,\\r\\nAnd newer fashions blow,\\r\\nDoth not retract a single spice\\r\\nFor pang of jealousy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer public is the noon,\\r\\nHer providence the

gauze,\\r\\nHis helmet is of gold;\\r\\nHis breast, a single onyx\\r\\nWith chrysoprase, inlaid.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis labor is a chant,\\r\\nHis idleness a tune;\\r\\nOh, for a bee\\'s experience\\r\\nOf clovers and of noon!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresentiment is that long shadow on the lawn\\r\\nIndicative that suns go down;\\r\\nThe notice to the startled grass\\r\\nThat

myself,\\r\\n\"That must have been the sun!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n        *  *  *\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how he set, I know not.\\r\\nThere seemed a purple stile\\r\\nWhich little yellow boys and girls\\r\\nWere climbing all the while\\r\\n\\r\\nTill when they reached the other side,\\r\\nA dominie in gray\\r\\nPut gently up the evening bars,\\r\\nAnd led the flock away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe butterfly\\'s assumption-gown,\\r\\nIn chrysoprase apartments hung,\\r\\n  This afternoon put on.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow condescending to

not a charge to me\\r\\nLike that old measure in the boughs,\\r\\nThat phraseless melody\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind does, working like a hand\\r\\nWhose fingers brush the sky,\\r\\nThen quiver down, with tufts of tune\\r\\nPermitted gods and me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen winds go round and round in bands,\\r\\nAnd thrum upon the door,\\r\\nAnd birds take places overhead,\\r\\nTo bear them orchestra,\\r\\n\\r\\nI crave him grace, of summer boughs,\\r\\nIf such an outcast be,\\r\\nHe never heard that fleshless chant\\r\\nRise solemn in the tree,\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if some caravan of sound\\r\\nOn deserts, in the sky,\\r\\nHad broken rank,\\r\\nThen knit, and passed\\r\\nIn seamless company.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXV.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEATH AND LIFE.\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently with no surprise\\r\\nTo any happy flower,\\r\\nThe frost beheads it at its play\\r\\nIn accidental power.\\r\\nThe blond assassin passes on,\\r\\nThe sun proceeds unmoved\\r\\nTo measure off another

HIGGINSON\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPREFACE\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson\\'s\\r\\npoems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern\\r\\nartificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the\\r\\nqualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest\\r\\nthemes,--life and love and death. That \"irresistible needle-touch,\"\\r\\nas one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very\\r\\ncore of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as\\r\\nit has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling\\r\\npower.  This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to\\r\\nform with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending\\r\\noccasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of\\r\\nher writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend \"H.H.\"\\r\\nmust at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th\\r\\nSeptember, 1884, she wrote:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR FRIEND,-- What portfolios full of verses\\r\\nyou must have! It is a cruel wrong to your \"day and\\r\\ngeneration\" that you will not give them light.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf such a thing should happen as that I should outlive\\r\\nyou, I wish you would make me your literary legatee\\r\\nand executor. Surely after you are what is called\\r\\n\"dead\" you will be willing that the poor ghosts you\\r\\nhave left behind should be cheered and pleased by your\\r\\nverses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think\\r\\nwe have a right to withhold from the world a word or\\r\\na thought any more than a deed which might help a\\r\\nsingle soul. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n                Truly yours,\\r\\n\\r\\n                        HELEN JACKSON.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"portfolios\" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson\\'s death,\\r\\nby her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had\\r\\nbeen carefully copied on sheets of note-paper, and tied in little\\r\\nfascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear\\r\\nevidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had\\r\\nreceived thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of\\r\\nrather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and\\r\\nphrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one\\r\\nform, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without\\r\\nimportant exception, her friends have generously placed at the\\r\\ndisposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and\\r\\nthese have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several\\r\\nrenderings of the same verse.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been\\r\\nsubjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They\\r\\nshould be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and\\r\\nsuggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some\\r\\ntime in the finished picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the\\r\\nwinter of 1862. In a letter to oone of the present Editors the\\r\\nApril following, she says, \"I made no verse, but one or two, until\\r\\nthis winter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running\\r\\nItalian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in\\r\\nbreadth of thought, it grew bolder and more abrupt, until in her\\r\\nlatest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its\\r\\nfellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones,\\r\\neverything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous\\r\\ndashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of\\r\\na page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and\\r\\nstrong.  The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of\\r\\nthe earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date,\\r\\nthe handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general\\r\\nchronologic accuracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a rule, the verses were without titles; but \"A Country Burial,\"\\r\\n\"A Thunder-Storm,\" \"The Humming-Bird,\" and a few others were named\\r\\nby their author, frequently at the end,--sometimes only in the\\r\\naccompanying note, if sent to a friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in\\r\\npencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of\\r\\nresponsibility upon her Editors. But all interference not\\r\\nabsolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her\\r\\nrendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it\\r\\nseems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and\\r\\nmore usual rhymes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike impressionist pictures, or Wagner\\'s rugged music, the very\\r\\nabsence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily\\r\\nDickinson\\'s exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic fitness of a\\r\\nparticular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything\\r\\nvirtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of\\r\\ninner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, and\\r\\nthe \"thought-rhyme\" appears frequently,--appealing, indeed, to an\\r\\nunrecognized sense more elusive than hearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness.\\r\\nEvery subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the\\r\\nsombre facts of death and burial, and the unknown life beyond. She\\r\\ntouches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost\\r\\nhumorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is\\r\\nnever by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critic\\r\\nhas said, she may exhibit toward God \"an Emersonian self-possession,\"\\r\\nit was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced\\r\\nas it is rare.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had tried society and the world, and found them lacking.  She\\r\\nwas not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no\\r\\nlove-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming of a nature\\r\\nintrospective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist\\r\\nin pretence.\\r\\n\\r\\nStorm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and\\r\\nbees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted\\r\\nhuman friends, were sufficient companionship. The coming of the\\r\\nfirst robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of\\r\\npope; the first red leaf hurrying through \"the altered air,\" an\\r\\nepoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or\\r\\nmelancholy, she lived in its presence.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                MABEL LOOMIS TODD.\\r\\n\\r\\n        AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS,\\r\\n            August, I891.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    My nosegays are for captives;\\r\\n       Dim, long-expectant eyes,\\r\\n    Fingers denied the plucking,\\r\\n       Patient till paradise,\\r\\n\\r\\n    To such, if they should whisper\\r\\n       Of morning and the moor,\\r\\n    They bear no other errand,\\r\\n       And I, no other prayer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI. LIFE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m nobody!  Who are you?\\r\\nAre you nobody, too?\\r\\nThen there \\'s a pair of us -- don\\'t tell!\\r\\nThey \\'d banish us, you know.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow dreary to be somebody!\\r\\nHow public, like a frog\\r\\nTo tell your name the livelong day\\r\\nTo an admiring bog!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII.\\r\\n\\r\\nI bring an unaccustomed wine\\r\\nTo lips long parching, next to mine,\\r\\nAnd summon them to drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrackling with fever, they essay;\\r\\nI turn my brimming eyes away,\\r\\nAnd come next hour to look.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hands still hug the tardy glass;\\r\\nThe lips I would have cooled, alas!\\r\\nAre so superfluous cold,\\r\\n\\r\\nI would as soon attempt to warm\\r\\nThe bosoms where the frost has lain\\r\\nAges beneath the mould.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome other thirsty there may be\\r\\nTo whom this would have pointed me\\r\\nHad it remained to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so I always bear the cup\\r\\nIf, haply, mine may be the drop\\r\\nSome pilgrim thirst to slake, --\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, haply, any say to me,\\r\\n\"Unto the little, unto me,\"\\r\\nWhen I at last awake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nearest dream recedes, unrealized.\\r\\n      The heaven we chase\\r\\n      Like the June bee\\r\\n      Before the school-boy\\r\\n      Invites the race;\\r\\n      Stoops to an easy clover --\\r\\nDips -- evades -- teases -- deploys;\\r\\n      Then to the royal clouds\\r\\n      Lifts his light pinnace\\r\\n      Heedless of the boy\\r\\nStaring, bewildered, at the mocking sky.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Homesick for steadfast honey,\\r\\n      Ah! the bee flies not\\r\\nThat brews that rare variety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe play at paste,\\r\\nTill qualified for pearl,\\r\\nThen drop the paste,\\r\\nAnd deem ourself a fool.\\r\\nThe shapes, though, were similar,\\r\\nAnd our new hands\\r\\nLearned gem-tactics\\r\\nPractising sands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found the phrase to every thought\\r\\nI ever had, but one;\\r\\nAnd that defies me, -- as a hand\\r\\nDid try to chalk the sun\\r\\n\\r\\nTo races nurtured in the dark; --\\r\\nHow would your own begin?\\r\\nCan blaze be done in cochineal,\\r\\nOr noon in mazarin?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nHOPE.\\r\\n\\r\\nHope is the thing with feathers\\r\\nThat perches in the soul,\\r\\nAnd sings the tune without the words,\\r\\nAnd never stops at all,\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd sweetest in the gale is heard;\\r\\nAnd sore must be the storm\\r\\nThat could abash the little bird\\r\\nThat kept so many warm.\\r\\n\\r\\nI \\'ve heard it in the chillest land,\\r\\nAnd on the strangest sea;\\r\\nYet, never, in extremity,\\r\\nIt asked a crumb of me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WHITE HEAT.\\r\\n\\r\\nDare you see a soul at the white heat?\\r\\n   Then crouch within the door.\\r\\nRed is the fire\\'s common tint;\\r\\n   But when the vivid ore\\r\\n\\r\\nHas sated flame\\'s conditions,\\r\\n   Its quivering substance plays\\r\\nWithout a color but the light\\r\\n   Of unanointed blaze.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeast village boasts its blacksmith,\\r\\n   Whose anvil\\'s even din\\r\\nStands symbol for the finer forge\\r\\n   That soundless tugs within,\\r\\n\\r\\nRefining these impatient ores\\r\\n   With hammer and with blaze,\\r\\nUntil the designated light\\r\\n   Repudiate the forge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTRIUMPHANT.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho never lost, are unprepared\\r\\nA coronet to find;\\r\\nWho never thirsted, flagons\\r\\nAnd cooling tamarind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho never climbed the weary league --\\r\\nCan such a foot explore\\r\\nThe purple territories\\r\\nOn Pizarro\\'s shore?\\r\\n\\r\\nHow many legions overcome?\\r\\nThe emperor will say.\\r\\nHow many colors taken\\r\\nOn Revolution Day?\\r\\n\\r\\nHow many bullets bearest?\\r\\nThe royal scar hast thou?\\r\\nAngels, write \"Promoted\"\\r\\nOn this soldier\\'s brow!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TEST.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can wade grief,\\r\\nWhole pools of it, --\\r\\nI \\'m used to that.\\r\\nBut the least push of joy\\r\\nBreaks up my feet,\\r\\nAnd I tip -- drunken.\\r\\nLet no pebble smile,\\r\\n\\'T was the new liquor, --\\r\\nThat was all!\\r\\n\\r\\nPower is only pain,\\r\\nStranded, through discipline,\\r\\nTill weights will hang.\\r\\nGive balm to giants,\\r\\nAnd they \\'ll wilt, like men.\\r\\nGive Himmaleh, --\\r\\nThey \\'ll carry him!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nX.\\r\\n\\r\\nESCAPE.\\r\\n\\r\\nI never hear the word \"escape\"\\r\\nWithout a quicker blood,\\r\\nA sudden expectation,\\r\\nA flying attitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nI never hear of prisons broad\\r\\nBy soldiers battered down,\\r\\nBut I tug childish at my bars, --\\r\\nOnly to fail again!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOMPENSATION.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor each ecstatic instant\\r\\nWe must an anguish pay\\r\\nIn keen and quivering ratio\\r\\nTo the ecstasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor each beloved hour\\r\\nSharp pittances of years,\\r\\nBitter contested farthings\\r\\nAnd coffers heaped with tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MARTYRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the straight pass of suffering\\r\\nThe martyrs even trod,\\r\\nTheir feet upon temptation,\\r\\nTheir faces upon God.\\r\\n\\r\\nA stately, shriven company;\\r\\nConvulsion playing round,\\r\\nHarmless as streaks of meteor\\r\\nUpon a planet\\'s bound.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir faith the everlasting troth;\\r\\nTheir expectation fair;\\r\\nThe needle to the north degree\\r\\nWades so, through polar air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nA PRAYER.\\r\\n\\r\\nI meant to have but modest needs,\\r\\nSuch as content, and heaven;\\r\\nWithin my income these could lie,\\r\\nAnd life and I keep even.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut since the last included both,\\r\\nIt would suffice my prayer\\r\\nBut just for one to stipulate,\\r\\nAnd grace would grant the pair.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, upon this wise I prayed, --\\r\\nGreat Spirit, give to me\\r\\nA heaven not so large as yours,\\r\\nBut large enough for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nA smile suffused Jehovah\\'s face;\\r\\nThe cherubim withdrew;\\r\\nGrave saints stole out to look at me,\\r\\nAnd showed their dimples, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nI left the place with all my might, --\\r\\nMy prayer away I threw;\\r\\nThe quiet ages picked it up,\\r\\nAnd Judgment twinkled, too,\\r\\n\\r\\nThat one so honest be extant\\r\\nAs take the tale for true\\r\\nThat \"Whatsoever you shall ask,\\r\\nItself be given you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I, grown shrewder, scan the skies\\r\\nWith a suspicious air, --\\r\\nAs children, swindled for the first,\\r\\nAll swindlers be, infer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought beneath so slight a film\\r\\nIs more distinctly seen, --\\r\\nAs laces just reveal the surge,\\r\\nOr mists the Apennine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXV.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soul unto itself\\r\\nIs an imperial friend, --\\r\\nOr the most agonizing spy\\r\\nAn enemy could send.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecure against its own,\\r\\nNo treason it can fear;\\r\\nItself its sovereign, of itself\\r\\nThe soul should stand in awe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurgeons must be very careful\\r\\nWhen they take the knife!\\r\\nUnderneath their fine incisions\\r\\nStirs the culprit, -- Life!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RAILWAY TRAIN.\\r\\n\\r\\nI like to see it lap the miles,\\r\\nAnd lick the valleys up,\\r\\nAnd stop to feed itself at tanks;\\r\\nAnd then, prodigious, step\\r\\n\\r\\nAround a pile of mountains,\\r\\nAnd, supercilious, peer\\r\\nIn shanties by the sides of roads;\\r\\nAnd then a quarry pare\\r\\n\\r\\nTo fit its sides, and crawl between,\\r\\nComplaining all the while\\r\\nIn horrid, hooting stanza;\\r\\nThen chase itself down hill\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd neigh like Boanerges;\\r\\nThen, punctual as a star,\\r\\nStop -- docile and omnipotent --\\r\\nAt its own stable door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SHOW.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show is not the show,\\r\\nBut they that go.\\r\\nMenagerie to me\\r\\nMy neighbor be.\\r\\nFair play --\\r\\nBoth went to see.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nDelight becomes pictorial\\r\\nWhen viewed through pain, --\\r\\nMore fair, because impossible\\r\\nThat any gain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mountain at a given distance\\r\\nIn amber lies;\\r\\nApproached, the amber flits a little, --\\r\\nAnd that \\'s the skies!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXX.\\r\\n\\r\\nA thought went up my mind to-day\\r\\nThat I have had before,\\r\\nBut did not finish, -- some way back,\\r\\nI could not fix the year,\\r\\n\\r\\nNor where it went, nor why it came\\r\\nThe second time to me,\\r\\nNor definitely what it was,\\r\\nHave I the art to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut somewhere in my soul, I know\\r\\nI \\'ve met the thing before;\\r\\nIt just reminded me -- \\'t was all --\\r\\nAnd came my way no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs Heaven a physician?\\r\\nThey say that He can heal;\\r\\nBut medicine posthumous\\r\\n   Is unavailable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs Heaven an

late, how late!\\r\\nSo I get home, \\'t will compensate.\\r\\nBetter will be the ecstasy\\r\\nThat they have done expecting me,\\r\\nWhen, night descending, dumb and dark,\\r\\nThey hear my unexpected knock.\\r\\nTransporting must the moment be,\\r\\nBrewed from decades of agony!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo think just how the fire will burn,\\r\\nJust how long-cheated eyes will turn\\r\\nTo wonder what myself will say,\\r\\nAnd what itself will say to me,\\r\\nBeguiles the centuries of way!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nA poor torn heart, a tattered heart,\\r\\nThat sat it down to rest,\\r\\nNor noticed that the ebbing day\\r\\nFlowed silver to the west,\\r\\nNor noticed night did soft descend\\r\\nNor constellation burn,\\r\\nIntent upon the vision\\r\\nOf latitudes unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe angels, happening that way,\\r\\nThis dusty heart espied;\\r\\nTenderly took it up from toil\\r\\nAnd carried it to God.\\r\\nThere, -- sandals for the barefoot;\\r\\nThere, -- gathered from the gales,\\r\\nDo the blue havens by the hand\\r\\nLead the wandering sails.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nTOO MUCH.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should have been too glad, I see,\\r\\nToo lifted for the scant degree\\r\\n   Of life\\'s penurious round;\\r\\nMy little circuit would have shamed\\r\\nThis new circumference, have blamed\\r\\n   The homelier time behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should have been too saved, I see,\\r\\nToo rescued; fear too dim to me\\r\\n   That I could spell the prayer\\r\\nI knew so perfect yesterday, --\\r\\nThat scalding one, \"Sabachthani,\"\\r\\n   Recited fluent here.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarth would have been too much, I see,\\r\\nAnd heaven not enough for me;\\r\\n   I should have had the joy\\r\\nWithout the fear to justify, --\\r\\nThe palm without the Calvary;\\r\\n   So, Saviour, crucify.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefeat whets victory, they say;\\r\\nThe reefs in old Gethsemane\\r\\n   Endear the shore beyond.\\r\\n\\'T is beggars

--\\r\\nA little brig I knew, --\\r\\nO\\'ertook by blast,\\r\\nIt spun and spun,\\r\\nAnd groped delirious, for morn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt slipped and slipped,\\r\\nAs one that drunken stepped;\\r\\nIts white foot tripped,\\r\\nThen dropped from sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, brig, good-night\\r\\nTo crew and you;\\r\\nThe ocean\\'s heart too smooth, too blue,\\r\\nTo break for you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictory comes late,\\r\\nAnd is held low to freezing lips\\r\\nToo rapt with frost\\r\\nTo take it.\\r\\nHow sweet it would have

starve!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nENOUGH.\\r\\n\\r\\nGod gave a loaf to every bird,\\r\\nBut just a crumb to me;\\r\\nI dare not eat it, though I starve, --\\r\\nMy poignant luxury\\r\\nTo own it, touch it, prove the feat\\r\\nThat made the pellet mine, --\\r\\nToo happy in my sparrow chance\\r\\nFor ampler coveting.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt might be famine all around,\\r\\nI could not miss an ear,\\r\\nSuch plenty smiles upon my board,\\r\\nMy garner shows so fair.\\r\\nI wonder how the rich may feel, --\\r\\nAn Indiaman -- an Earl?\\r\\nI deem that I with but a crumb\\r\\nAm

SEA.\\r\\n\\r\\nI started early, took my dog,\\r\\nAnd visited the sea;\\r\\nThe mermaids in the basement\\r\\nCame out to look at me,\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd frigates in the upper floor\\r\\nExtended hempen hands,\\r\\nPresuming me to be a mouse\\r\\nAground, upon the sands.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no man moved me till the tide\\r\\nWent past my simple shoe,\\r\\nAnd past my apron and my belt,\\r\\nAnd past my bodice too,\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd made as he would eat me up\\r\\nAs wholly as a dew\\r\\nUpon a dandelion\\'s sleeve --\\r\\nAnd then I started too.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he -- he followed close behind;\\r\\nI felt his silver heel\\r\\nUpon my ankle, -- then my shoes\\r\\nWould overflow with pearl.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil we met the solid town,\\r\\nNo man he seemed to know;\\r\\nAnd bowing with a mighty look\\r\\nAt me, the sea withdrew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXX.\\r\\n\\r\\nOLD-FASHIONED.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcturus is his other name, --\\r\\nI\\'d rather call him star!\\r\\nIt\\'s so unkind of

took the butterfly\\r\\nAforetime in my hat,\\r\\nHe sits erect in cabinets,\\r\\nThe clover-bells forgot.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat once was heaven, is zenith now.\\r\\nWhere I proposed to go\\r\\nWhen time\\'s brief masquerade was done,\\r\\nIs mapped, and charted too!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat if the poles should frisk about\\r\\nAnd stand upon their heads!\\r\\nI hope I \\'m ready for the worst,\\r\\nWhatever prank betides!\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the kingdom of Heaven \\'s changed!\\r\\nI hope the children there\\r\\nWon\\'t be new-fashioned when I come,\\r\\nAnd laugh at me, and

heaven and earth from view.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creatures chuckled on the roofs\\r\\nAnd whistled in the air,\\r\\nAnd shook their fists and gnashed their teeth.\\r\\nAnd swung their frenzied

Paradise!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SEA.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn everywhere of silver,\\r\\nWith ropes of sand\\r\\nTo keep it from effacing\\r\\nThe track called

raw.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then he drank a dew\\r\\nFrom a convenient grass,\\r\\nAnd then hopped sidewise to the wall\\r\\nTo let a beetle pass.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced with rapid eyes\\r\\nThat hurried all abroad, --\\r\\nThey looked like frightened beads, I thought;\\r\\nHe stirred his velvet head\\r\\n\\r\\nLike one in danger; cautious,\\r\\nI offered him a crumb,\\r\\nAnd he unrolled his feathers\\r\\nAnd rowed him softer home\\r\\n\\r\\nThan oars divide the ocean,\\r\\nToo silver for a seam,\\r\\nOr butterflies, off banks of noon,\\r\\nLeap, plashless, as they swim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SNAKE.\\r\\n\\r\\nA narrow fellow in the grass\\r\\nOccasionally rides;\\r\\nYou may have met him, -- did you not,\\r\\nHis notice sudden is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grass divides as with a comb,\\r\\nA spotted shaft is seen;\\r\\nAnd then it closes at your feet\\r\\nAnd opens further on.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe likes a boggy acre,\\r\\nA floor too cool for corn.\\r\\nYet when a child, and barefoot,\\r\\nI more than once, at morn,\\r\\n\\r\\nHave passed, I thought, a whip-lash\\r\\nUnbraiding in the sun, --\\r\\nWhen, stooping to secure it,\\r\\nIt wrinkled, and was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral of nature\\'s people\\r\\nI know, and they know me;\\r\\nI feel for them a transport\\r\\nOf cordiality;\\r\\n\\r\\nBut never met this fellow,\\r\\nAttended or alone,\\r\\nWithout a tighter breathing,\\r\\nAnd zero at the bone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXV.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MUSHROOM.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mushroom is the elf of plants,\\r\\nAt evening it is not;\\r\\nAt morning in a truffled hut\\r\\nIt stops upon a spot\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if it tarried always;\\r\\nAnd yet its whole career\\r\\nIs shorter than a snake\\'s delay,\\r\\nAnd fleeter than a tare.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'T is vegetation\\'s juggler,\\r\\nThe germ of alibi;\\r\\nDoth like a bubble antedate,\\r\\nAnd like a bubble hie.\\r\\n\\r\\nI feel as if the grass were pleased\\r\\nTo have it intermit;\\r\\nThe surreptitious scion\\r\\nOf summer\\'s circumspect.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad nature any outcast face,\\r\\nCould she a son contemn,\\r\\nHad nature an Iscariot,\\r\\nThat mushroom, -- it is him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STORM.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere came a wind like a bugle;\\r\\nIt quivered through the grass,\\r\\nAnd a green chill upon the heat\\r\\nSo ominous did pass\\r\\nWe barred the windows and the doors\\r\\nAs from an emerald ghost;\\r\\nThe doom\\'s electric moccason\\r\\nThat very instant passed.\\r\\nOn a strange mob of panting trees,\\r\\nAnd fences fled away,\\r\\nAnd rivers where the houses ran\\r\\nThe living looked that day.\\r\\nThe bell within the steeple wild\\r\\nThe flying tidings whirled.\\r\\nHow much can come\\r\\nAnd much can go,\\r\\nAnd yet abide the world!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SPIDER.\\r\\n\\r\\nA spider sewed at night\\r\\nWithout a light\\r\\nUpon an arc of white.\\r\\nIf ruff it

struggles in the lanes,\\r\\nHer heart misgives her for her vow,\\r\\nAnd she pours soft refrains\\r\\n\\r\\nInto the lap of adamant,\\r\\nAnd spices, and the dew,\\r\\nThat stiffens quietly to

the feet of the old horizon\\r\\nLaying her spotted face, to die;\\r\\n\\r\\nStooping as low as the otter\\'s window,\\r\\nTouching the roof and tinting the barn,\\r\\nKissing her bonnet to the

celebrates\\r\\nIts unobtrusive mass.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo ordinance is seen,\\r\\nSo gradual the grace,\\r\\nA pensive custom it becomes,\\r\\nEnlarging loneliness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAntiquest felt at noon\\r\\nWhen August, burning low,\\r\\nCalls forth this spectral canticle,\\r\\nRepose to typify.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemit as yet no grace,\\r\\nNo furrow on the glow,\\r\\nYet a druidic difference\\r\\nEnhances nature now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLV.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs imperceptibly as grief\\r\\nThe summer lapsed away, --\\r\\nToo imperceptible, at last,\\r\\nTo seem like perfidy.\\r\\n\\r\\nA quietness distilled,\\r\\nAs twilight long begun,\\r\\nOr Nature, spending with herself\\r\\nSequestered afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dusk drew earlier in,\\r\\nThe morning foreign shone, --\\r\\nA courteous, yet harrowing grace,\\r\\nAs guest who would be gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus, without a wing,\\r\\nOr service of a keel,\\r\\nOur summer made her light escape\\r\\nInto the

--\\r\\nThe bobolink was there,\\r\\nAn aged bee addressed us,\\r\\nAnd then we knelt in prayer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe trust that she was willing, --\\r\\nWe ask that we may be.\\r\\nSummer, sister,

fence,\\r\\nIt wraps it, rail by rail,\\r\\nTill it is lost in fleeces;\\r\\nIt flings a crystal veil\\r\\n\\r\\nOn stump and stack and stem, --\\r\\nThe summer\\'s empty room,\\r\\nAcres of seams where harvests were,\\r\\nRecordless, but for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt ruffles wrists of posts,\\r\\nAs ankles of a queen, --\\r\\nThen stills its artisans like ghosts,\\r\\nDenying they have been.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLI.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BLUE JAY.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo brigadier throughout the year\\r\\nSo civic as the jay.\\r\\nA neighbor and a warrior too,\\r\\nWith shrill felicity\\r\\n\\r\\nPursuing winds that censure us\\r\\nA February day,\\r\\nThe brother of the universe\\r\\nWas never blown away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe snow and he are intimate;\\r\\nI \\'ve often seen them play\\r\\nWhen heaven looked upon us all\\r\\nWith such severity,\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt apology were due\\r\\nTo an insulted sky,\\r\\nWhose pompous frown was nutriment\\r\\nTo their temerity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pillow of this daring head\\r\\nIs pungent evergreens;\\r\\nHis larder -- terse and militant --\\r\\nUnknown, refreshing things;\\r\\n\\r\\nHis character a tonic,\\r\\nHis

as flocks go home at night\\r\\nUnto the shepherd\\'s arm!\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps you \\'re going too!\\r\\nWho knows?\\r\\nIf you should get there first,\\r\\nSave just a little place for me\\r\\nClose to the two I lost!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe smallest \"robe\" will fit me,\\r\\nAnd just a bit of \"crown;\"\\r\\nFor you know we do not mind our dress\\r\\nWhen we are going home.\\r\\n\\r\\nI \\'m glad I don\\'t believe it,\\r\\nFor it would stop my breath,\\r\\nAnd I \\'d like to look a little more\\r\\nAt such a curious earth!\\r\\nI am glad they did believe it\\r\\nWhom I have never found\\r\\nSince the mighty autumn afternoon\\r\\nI left them in the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least to pray is left, is left.\\r\\nO Jesus! in the air\\r\\nI know

for me?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nEPITAPH.\\r\\n\\r\\nStep lightly on this narrow spot!\\r\\nThe broadest land that grows\\r\\nIs not so ample as the breast\\r\\nThese emerald

syllable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV.\\r\\n\\r\\nMorns like these we parted;\\r\\nNoons like these she rose,\\r\\nFluttering first, then firmer,\\r\\nTo her fair repose.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever did she lisp it,\\r\\nAnd \\'t was not for me;\\r\\nShe was mute from transport,\\r\\nI, from agony!\\r\\n\\r\\nTill the evening, nearing,\\r\\nOne the shutters drew --\\r\\nQuick! a sharper rustling!\\r\\nAnd this linnet flew!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nA death-blow is a life-blow to some\\r\\nWho, till they died, did not alive become;\\r\\nWho, had they lived, had

its extremest clause, --\\r\\n\\r\\nThe date, and manner of the shame;\\r\\nAnd then the pious form\\r\\nThat \"God have mercy\" on the soul\\r\\nThe jury voted him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI made my soul familiar\\r\\nWith her extremity,\\r\\nThat at the last it should not be\\r\\nA novel agony,\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she and Death, acquainted,\\r\\nMeet tranquilly as friends,\\r\\nSalute and pass without a hint --\\r\\nAnd there the matter ends.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have not told my garden yet,\\r\\nLest that should conquer me;\\r\\nI have not quite the strength now\\r\\nTo break it to the bee.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will not name it in the street,\\r\\nFor shops would stare, that I,\\r\\nSo shy, so very ignorant,\\r\\nShould have the face to die.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hillsides must not know it,\\r\\nWhere I have rambled so,\\r\\nNor tell the loving forests\\r\\nThe day that I shall go,\\r\\n\\r\\nNor lisp it at the table,\\r\\nNor heedless by the way\\r\\nHint that within the riddle\\r\\nOne will walk to-day!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BATTLE-FIELD.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars,\\r\\n   Like petals from a rose,\\r\\nWhen suddenly across the June\\r\\n   A wind with fingers goes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey perished in the seamless grass, --\\r\\n   No eye could find the place;\\r\\nBut God on his repealless list\\r\\n   Can summon every face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nX.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only ghost I ever saw\\r\\nWas dressed in mechlin, -- so;\\r\\nHe wore no sandal on his foot,\\r\\nAnd stepped like flakes of snow.\\r\\nHis gait was soundless, like the bird,\\r\\nBut rapid, like the roe;\\r\\nHis fashions quaint, mosaic,\\r\\nOr, haply, mistletoe.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis conversation seldom,\\r\\nHis laughter like the breeze\\r\\nThat dies away in dimples\\r\\nAmong the pensive trees.\\r\\nOur interview was transient,--\\r\\nOf me, himself was shy;\\r\\nAnd God forbid I look behind\\r\\nSince that appalling day!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome, too fragile for winter winds,\\r\\nThe thoughtful grave encloses, --\\r\\nTenderly tucking them in from frost\\r\\nBefore their feet are cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever the treasures in her nest\\r\\nThe cautious grave exposes,\\r\\nBuilding where schoolboy dare not look\\r\\nAnd sportsman is not bold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis covert have all the children\\r\\nEarly aged, and often cold, --\\r\\nSparrows unnoticed by the Father;\\r\\nLambs for whom time had not a fold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs by the dead we love to sit,\\r\\nBecome so wondrous dear,\\r\\nAs for the lost we grapple,\\r\\nThough all the rest are here, --\\r\\n\\r\\nIn broken mathematics\\r\\nWe estimate our prize,\\r\\nVast, in its fading ratio,\\r\\nTo our penurious eyes!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nMEMORIALS.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath sets a thing significant\\r\\nThe eye had hurried by,\\r\\nExcept a perished creature\\r\\nEntreat us tenderly\\r\\n\\r\\nTo ponder little workmanships\\r\\nIn crayon or in wool,\\r\\nWith \"This was last her fingers did,\"\\r\\nIndustrious until\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thimble weighed too heavy,\\r\\nThe stitches stopped themselves,\\r\\nAnd then \\'t was put among the dust\\r\\nUpon the closet shelves.\\r\\n\\r\\nA book I have, a friend gave,\\r\\nWhose pencil, here and there,\\r\\nHad notched the place that pleased him, --\\r\\nAt rest his fingers are.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when I read, I read not,\\r\\nFor interrupting tears\\r\\nObliterate the etchings\\r\\nToo costly for repairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went to heaven, --\\r\\n\\'T was a small town,\\r\\nLit with a ruby,\\r\\nLathed with down.\\r\\nStiller than the fields\\r\\nAt the full dew,\\r\\nBeautiful as pictures\\r\\nNo man drew.\\r\\nPeople like the moth,\\r\\nOf mechlin, frames,\\r\\nDuties of gossamer,\\r\\nAnd eider names.\\r\\nAlmost contented\\r\\nI could be\\r\\n\\'Mong such unique\\r\\nSociety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXV.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir height in heaven comforts not,\\r\\nTheir glory nought to me;\\r\\n\\'T was best imperfect, as it was;\\r\\nI \\'m finite, I can\\'t see.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house of supposition,\\r\\nThe glimmering frontier\\r\\nThat skirts the acres of perhaps,\\r\\nTo me shows insecure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wealth I had contented me;\\r\\nIf \\'t was a meaner size,\\r\\nThen I had counted it until\\r\\nIt pleased my narrow eyes\\r\\n\\r\\nBetter than larger values,\\r\\nHowever true their show;\\r\\nThis timid life of evidence\\r\\nKeeps pleading, \"I don\\'t know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a shame of nobleness\\r\\nConfronting sudden pelf, --\\r\\nA finer shame of ecstasy\\r\\nConvicted of itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nA best disgrace a brave man feels,\\r\\nAcknowledged of the brave, --\\r\\nOne more \"Ye Blessed\" to be told;\\r\\nBut this involves the grave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTRIUMPH.\\r\\n\\r\\nTriumph may be of several kinds.\\r\\nThere \\'s triumph in the room\\r\\nWhen that old imperator, Death,\\r\\nBy faith is overcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere \\'s triumph of the finer mind\\r\\nWhen truth, affronted long,\\r\\nAdvances calm to her supreme,\\r\\nHer God her only throng.\\r\\n\\r\\nA triumph when temptation\\'s bribe\\r\\nIs slowly handed back,\\r\\nOne eye upon the heaven renounced\\r\\nAnd one upon the rack.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeverer triumph, by himself\\r\\nExperienced, who can pass\\r\\nAcquitted from that naked bar,\\r\\nJehovah\\'s countenance!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nPompless no life can pass away;\\r\\n    The lowliest career\\r\\nTo the same pageant wends its way\\r\\n    As that exalted here.\\r\\nHow cordial is the mystery!\\r\\n    The hospitable pall\\r\\nA \"this way\" beckons spaciously, --\\r\\n    A miracle for all!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nI noticed people disappeared,\\r\\nWhen but a little child, --\\r\\nSupposed they visited remote,\\r\\nOr settled regions wild.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow know I they both visited\\r\\nAnd settled regions wild,\\r\\nBut did because they died, -- a fact\\r\\nWithheld the little child!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXX.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOLLOWING.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had no cause to be awake,\\r\\nMy best was gone to sleep,\\r\\nAnd morn a new politeness took,\\r\\nAnd failed to wake them up,\\r\\n\\r\\nBut called the others clear,\\r\\nAnd passed their curtains by.\\r\\nSweet morning, when I over-sleep,\\r\\nKnock, recollect, for me!\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at sunrise once,\\r\\nAnd then I looked at them,\\r\\nAnd wishfulness in me arose\\r\\nFor circumstance the same.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'T was such an ample peace,\\r\\nIt could not hold a sigh, --\\r\\n\\'T was Sabbath with the bells divorced,\\r\\n\\'T was sunset all the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo choosing but a gown\\r\\nAnd taking but a prayer,\\r\\nThe only raiment I should need,\\r\\nI struggled, and was there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf anybody\\'s friend be dead,\\r\\nIt \\'s sharpest of the theme\\r\\nThe thinking how they walked alive,\\r\\nAt such and such a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir costume, of a Sunday,\\r\\nSome manner of the hair, --\\r\\nA prank nobody knew but them,\\r\\nLost, in the sepulchre.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow warm they were on such a day:\\r\\nYou almost feel the date,\\r\\nSo short way off it seems; and now,\\r\\nThey \\'re centuries from that.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow pleased they were at what you said;\\r\\nYou try to touch the smile,\\r\\nAnd dip your fingers in the frost:\\r\\nWhen was it, can you tell,\\r\\n\\r\\nYou asked the company to tea,\\r\\nAcquaintance, just a few,\\r\\nAnd chatted close with this grand thing\\r\\nThat don\\'t remember you?\\r\\n\\r\\nPast bows and invitations,\\r\\nPast interview, and vow,\\r\\nPast what ourselves can estimate, --\\r\\nThat makes the quick of woe!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE JOURNEY.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur journey had advanced;\\r\\nOur feet were almost come\\r\\nTo that odd fork in Being\\'s road,\\r\\nEternity by term.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur pace took sudden awe,\\r\\nOur feet reluctant led.\\r\\nBefore were cities, but between,\\r\\nThe forest of the dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nRetreat was out of hope, --\\r\\nBehind, a sealed route,\\r\\nEternity\\'s white flag before,\\r\\nAnd God at every gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nA COUNTRY BURIAL.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmple make this bed.\\r\\nMake this bed with awe;\\r\\nIn it wait till judgment break\\r\\nExcellent and fair.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe its mattress straight,\\r\\nBe its pillow round;\\r\\nLet no sunrise\\' yellow noise\\r\\nInterrupt this ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nGOING.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn such a night, or such a night,\\r\\nWould anybody care\\r\\nIf such a little figure\\r\\nSlipped quiet from its chair,\\r\\n\\r\\nSo quiet, oh, how quiet!\\r\\nThat nobody might know\\r\\nBut that the little figure\\r\\nRocked softer, to and fro?\\r\\n\\r\\nOn such a dawn, or such a dawn,\\r\\nWould anybody sigh\\r\\nThat such a little figure\\r\\nToo sound asleep did lie\\r\\n\\r\\nFor chanticleer to wake it, --\\r\\nOr stirring house below,\\r\\nOr giddy bird in orchard,\\r\\nOr early task to do?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a little figure plump\\r\\nFor every little knoll,\\r\\nBusy needles, and spools of thread,\\r\\nAnd trudging feet from school.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaymates, and holidays, and nuts,\\r\\nAnd visions vast and small.\\r\\nStrange that the feet so precious charged\\r\\nShould reach so small a goal!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXV.\\r\\n\\r\\nEssential oils are wrung:\\r\\nThe attar from the rose\\r\\nIs not expressed by suns alone,\\r\\nIt is the gift of screws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general rose decays;\\r\\nBut this, in lady\\'s drawer,\\r\\nMakes summer when the lady lies\\r\\nIn ceaseless rosemary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nI lived on dread; to those who know\\r\\nThe stimulus there is\\r\\nIn danger, other impetus\\r\\nIs numb and vital-less.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs \\'t were a spur upon the soul,\\r\\nA fear will urge it where\\r\\nTo go without the spectre\\'s aid\\r\\nWere challenging despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I should die,\\r\\nAnd you should live,\\r\\nAnd time should gurgle on,\\r\\nAnd morn should beam,\\r\\nAnd noon should burn,\\r\\nAs it has usual done;\\r\\nIf birds should build as early,\\r\\nAnd bees as bustling go, --\\r\\nOne might depart at option\\r\\nFrom enterprise below!\\r\\n\\'T is sweet to know that stocks will stand\\r\\nWhen we with daisies lie,\\r\\nThat commerce will continue,\\r\\nAnd trades as briskly fly.\\r\\nIt makes the parting tranquil\\r\\nAnd keeps the soul serene,\\r\\nThat gentlemen so sprightly\\r\\nConduct the pleasing scene!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nAT LENGTH.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer final summer was it,\\r\\nAnd yet we guessed it not;\\r\\nIf tenderer industriousness\\r\\nPervaded her, we thought\\r\\n\\r\\nA further force of life\\r\\nDeveloped from within, --\\r\\nWhen Death lit all the shortness up,\\r\\nAnd made the hurry plain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe wondered at our blindness, --\\r\\nWhen nothing was to see\\r\\nBut her Carrara guide-post, --\\r\\nAt our stupidity,\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, duller than our dulness,\\r\\nThe busy darling lay,\\r\\nSo busy was she, finishing,\\r\\nSo leisurely were we!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nGHOSTS.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne need not be a chamber to be haunted,\\r\\nOne need not be a house;\\r\\nThe brain has corridors surpassing\\r\\nMaterial place.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar safer, of a midnight meeting\\r\\nExternal ghost,\\r\\nThan an interior confronting\\r\\nThat whiter host.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar safer through an Abbey gallop,\\r\\nThe stones achase,\\r\\nThan, moonless, one\\'s own self encounter\\r\\nIn lonesome place.\\r\\n\\r\\nOurself, behind ourself concealed,\\r\\nShould startle most;\\r\\nAssassin, hid in our apartment,\\r\\nBe horror\\'s least.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prudent carries a revolver,\\r\\nHe bolts the door,\\r\\nO\\'erlooking a superior spectre\\r\\nMore near.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXX.\\r\\n\\r\\nVANISHED.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe died, -- this was the way she died;\\r\\nAnd when her breath was done,\\r\\nTook up her simple wardrobe\\r\\nAnd started for the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer little figure at the gate\\r\\nThe angels must have spied,\\r\\nSince I could never find her\\r\\nUpon the mortal side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRECEDENCE.\\r\\n\\r\\nWait till the majesty of Death\\r\\nInvests so mean a brow!\\r\\nAlmost a powdered footman\\r\\nMight dare to touch it now!\\r\\n\\r\\nWait till in everlasting robes\\r\\nThis democrat is dressed,\\r\\nThen prate about \"preferment\"\\r\\nAnd \"station\" and the rest!\\r\\n\\r\\nAround this quiet courtier\\r\\nObsequious angels wait!\\r\\nFull royal is his retinue,\\r\\nFull purple is his state!\\r\\n\\r\\nA lord might dare to lift the hat\\r\\nTo such a modest clay,\\r\\nSince that my Lord, \"the Lord of lords\"\\r\\nReceives unblushingly!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nGONE.\\r\\n\\r\\nWent up a year this evening!\\r\\nI recollect it well!\\r\\nAmid no bells nor bravos\\r\\nThe bystanders will tell!\\r\\nCheerful, as to the village,\\r\\nTranquil, as to repose,\\r\\nChastened, as to the chapel,\\r\\nThis humble tourist rose.\\r\\nDid not talk of returning,\\r\\nAlluded to no time\\r\\nWhen, were the gales propitious,\\r\\nWe might look for him;\\r\\nWas grateful for the roses\\r\\nIn life\\'s diverse bouquet,\\r\\nTalked softly of new species\\r\\nTo pick another day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeguiling thus the wonder,\\r\\nThe wondrous nearer drew;\\r\\nHands bustled at the moorings --\\r\\nThe crowd respectful grew.\\r\\nAscended from our vision\\r\\nTo countenances new!\\r\\nA difference, a daisy,\\r\\nIs all the rest I knew!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nREQUIEM.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaken from men this morning,\\r\\nCarried by men to-day,\\r\\nMet by the gods with banners\\r\\nWho marshalled her away.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne little maid from playmates,\\r\\nOne little mind from school, --\\r\\nThere must be guests in Eden;\\r\\nAll the rooms are full.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar as the east from even,\\r\\nDim as the border star, --\\r\\nCourtiers quaint, in kingdoms,\\r\\nOur departed are.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat inn is this\\r\\nWhere for the night\\r\\nPeculiar traveller comes?\\r\\nWho is the landlord?\\r\\nWhere the maids?\\r\\nBehold, what curious rooms!\\r\\nNo ruddy fires on the hearth,\\r\\nNo brimming tankards flow.\\r\\nNecromancer, landlord,\\r\\nWho are these below?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXV.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not death, for I stood up,\\r\\nAnd all the dead lie down;\\r\\nIt was not night, for all the bells\\r\\nPut out their tongues, for noon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not frost, for on my flesh\\r\\nI felt siroccos crawl, --\\r\\nNor fire, for just my marble feet\\r\\nCould keep a chancel cool.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet it tasted like them all;\\r\\nThe figures I have seen\\r\\nSet orderly, for burial,\\r\\nReminded me of mine,\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if my life were shaven\\r\\nAnd fitted to a frame,\\r\\nAnd could not breathe without a key;\\r\\nAnd \\'t was like midnight, some,\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen everything that ticked has stopped,\\r\\nAnd space stares, all around,\\r\\nOr grisly frosts, first autumn morns,\\r\\nRepeal the beating ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut most like chaos, -- stopless, cool, --\\r\\nWithout a chance or spar,\\r\\nOr even a report of land\\r\\nTo justify despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nTILL THE END.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should not dare to leave my friend,\\r\\nBecause -- because if he should die\\r\\nWhile I was gone, and I -- too late --\\r\\nShould reach the heart that wanted me;\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I should disappoint the eyes\\r\\nThat hunted, hunted so, to see,\\r\\nAnd could not bear to shut until\\r\\nThey \"noticed\" me -- they noticed me;\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I should stab the patient faith\\r\\nSo sure I \\'d come -- so sure I \\'d come,\\r\\nIt listening, listening, went to sleep\\r\\nTelling my tardy name, --\\r\\n\\r\\nMy heart would wish it broke before,\\r\\nSince breaking then, since breaking then,\\r\\nWere useless as next morning\\'s sun,\\r\\nWhere midnight frosts had lain!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nVOID.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat streets of silence led away\\r\\nTo neighborhoods of pause;\\r\\nHere was no notice, no dissent,\\r\\nNo universe, no laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy clocks \\'t was morning, and for night\\r\\nThe bells at distance called;\\r\\nBut epoch had no basis here,\\r\\nFor period exhaled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nA throe upon the features\\r\\nA hurry in the breath,\\r\\nAn ecstasy of parting\\r\\nDenominated \"Death,\" --\\r\\n\\r\\nAn anguish at the mention,\\r\\nWhich, when to patience grown,\\r\\nI \\'ve known permission given\\r\\nTo rejoin its own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nSAVED!\\r\\n\\r\\nOf tribulation these are they\\r\\nDenoted by the white;\\r\\nThe spangled gowns, a lesser rank\\r\\nOf victors designate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these did conquer; but the ones\\r\\nWho overcame most times\\r\\nWear nothing commoner than snow,\\r\\nNo ornament but palms.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurrender is a sort unknown\\r\\nOn this superior soil;\\r\\nDefeat, an outgrown anguish,\\r\\nRemembered as the mile\\r\\n\\r\\nOur panting ankle barely gained\\r\\nWhen night devoured the road;\\r\\nBut we stood whispering in the house,\\r\\nAnd all we said was \"Saved\"!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXL.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think just how my shape will rise\\r\\nWhen I shall be forgiven,\\r\\nTill hair and eyes and timid head\\r\\nAre out of sight, in heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think just how my lips will weigh\\r\\nWith shapeless, quivering prayer\\r\\nThat you, so late, consider me,\\r\\nThe sparrow of your care.\\r\\n\\r\\nI mind me that of anguish sent,\\r\\nSome drifts were moved away\\r\\nBefore my simple bosom broke, --\\r\\nAnd why not this, if they?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, until delirious borne\\r\\nI con that thing, -- \"forgiven,\" --\\r\\nTill with long fright and longer trust\\r\\nI drop my heart, unshriven!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLI.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FORGOTTEN GRAVE.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a hundred years\\r\\nNobody knows the place, --\\r\\nAgony, that enacted there,\\r\\nMotionless as peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeeds triumphant ranged,\\r\\nStrangers strolled and spelled\\r\\nAt the lone orthography\\r\\nOf the elder dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWinds of summer fields\\r\\nRecollect the way, --\\r\\nInstinct picking up the key\\r\\nDropped by memory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLII.\\r\\n\\r\\nLay this laurel on the one\\r\\nToo intrinsic for renown.\\r\\nLaurel! veil your deathless tree, --\\r\\nHim you chasten, that is he!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPOEMS\\r\\n\\r\\nby EMILY DICKINSON\\r\\n\\r\\nThird Series\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEdited by\\r\\n\\r\\nMABEL LOOMIS TODD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    It\\'s all I have to bring to-day,\\r\\n      This, and my heart beside,\\r\\n    This, and my heart, and all the fields,\\r\\n      And all the meadows wide.\\r\\n    Be sure you count, should I forget, --\\r\\n      Some one the sum could tell, --\\r\\n    This, and my heart, and all the bees\\r\\n      Which in the clover dwell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPREFACE.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intellectual activity of Emily Dickinson was so great that\\r\\na large and characteristic choice is still possible among her\\r\\nliterary material, and this third volume of her verses is put\\r\\nforth in response to the repeated wish of the admirers of her\\r\\npeculiar genius. Much of Emily Dickinson\\'s prose was rhythmic,\\r\\n--even rhymed, though frequently not set apart in lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso many verses, written as such, were sent to friends in\\r\\nletters; these were published in 1894, in the volumes of her\\r\\n_Letters_. It has not been necessary, however, to include them in\\r\\nthis Series, and all have been omitted, except three or four\\r\\nexceptionally strong ones, as \"A Book,\" and \"With Flowers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is internal evidence that many of the poems were simply\\r\\nspontaneous flashes of insight, apparently unrelated to outward\\r\\ncircumstance. Others, however, had an obvious personal origin;\\r\\nfor example, the verses \"I had a Guinea golden,\" which seem to\\r\\nhave been sent to some friend travelling in Europe, as a dainty\\r\\nreminder of letter-writing delinquencies. The surroundings in\\r\\nwhich any of Emily Dickinson\\'s verses are known to have been\\r\\nwritten usually serve to explain them clearly; but in general the\\r\\npresent volume is full of thoughts needing no interpretation to\\r\\nthose who apprehend this scintillating spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        M.

LIFE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI.\\r\\n\\r\\nREAL RICHES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'T is little I could care for pearls\\r\\n  Who own the ample sea;\\r\\nOr brooches, when the Emperor\\r\\n  With rubies pelteth me;\\r\\n\\r\\nOr gold, who am the Prince of Mines;\\r\\n  Or diamonds, when I see\\r\\nA diadem to fit a dome\\r\\n  Continual crowning me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII.\\r\\n\\r\\nSUPERIORITY TO FATE.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuperiority to fate\\r\\n  Is difficult to learn.\\r\\n\\'T is not conferred by any,\\r\\n  But possible to earn\\r\\n\\r\\nA pittance at a time,\\r\\n  Until, to her surprise,\\r\\nThe soul with strict economy\\r\\n  Subsists till Paradise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nHOPE.\\r\\n\\r\\nHope is a subtle glutton;\\r\\n  He feeds upon the fair;\\r\\nAnd yet, inspected closely,\\r\\n  What abstinence is there!\\r\\n\\r\\nHis is the halcyon table\\r\\n  That never seats but one,\\r\\nAnd whatsoever is consumed\\r\\n  The same amounts remain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nFORBIDDEN FRUIT.\\r\\n\\r\\nI.\\r\\n\\r\\nForbidden fruit a flavor has\\r\\n  That lawful orchards mocks;\\r\\nHow luscious lies the pea within\\r\\n  The pod that Duty locks!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV.\\r\\n\\r\\nFORBIDDEN FRUIT.\\r\\n\\r\\nII.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeaven is what I cannot reach!\\r\\n  The apple on the tree,\\r\\nProvided it do hopeless hang,\\r\\n  That \\'heaven\\' is, to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe color on the cruising cloud,\\r\\n  The interdicted ground\\r\\nBehind the hill, the house behind, --\\r\\n  There Paradise is found!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nA WORD.\\r\\n\\r\\nA word is dead\\r\\nWhen it is said,\\r\\n  Some say.\\r\\nI say it just\\r\\nBegins to live\\r\\n  That day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo venerate the simple days\\r\\n  Which lead the seasons by,\\r\\nNeeds but to remember\\r\\n  That from you or me\\r\\nThey may take the trifle\\r\\n  Termed mortality!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo invest existence with a stately air,\\r\\nNeeds but to remember\\r\\n  That the acorn there\\r\\nIs the egg of forests\\r\\n  For the upper air!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nLIFE\\'S TRADES.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s such a little thing to weep,\\r\\n  So short a thing to sigh;\\r\\nAnd yet by trades the size of these\\r\\n  We men and women die!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrowning is not so pitiful\\r\\n  As the attempt to rise.\\r\\nThree times, \\'t is said, a sinking man\\r\\n  Comes up to face the skies,\\r\\nAnd then declines forever\\r\\n  To that abhorred abode\\r\\nWhere hope and he part company, --\\r\\n  For he is grasped of God.\\r\\nThe Maker\\'s cordial visage,\\r\\n  However good to see,\\r\\nIs shunned, we must admit it,\\r\\n  Like an adversity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nX.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow still the bells in steeples stand,\\r\\n  Till, swollen with the sky,\\r\\nThey leap upon their silver feet\\r\\n  In frantic melody!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the foolish call them \\'flowers,\\'\\r\\n  Need the wiser tell?\\r\\nIf the savans \\'classify\\' them,\\r\\n  It is just as well!\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who read the Revelations\\r\\n  Must not criticise\\r\\nThose who read the same edition\\r\\n  With beclouded eyes!\\r\\n\\r\\nCould we stand with that old Moses\\r\\n  Canaan denied, --\\r\\nScan, like him, the stately landscape\\r\\n  On the other side, --\\r\\n\\r\\nDoubtless we should deem superfluous\\r\\n  Many sciences\\r\\nNot pursued by learned angels\\r\\n  In scholastic skies!\\r\\n\\r\\nLow amid that glad _Belles lettres_\\r\\n  Grant that we may stand,\\r\\nStars, amid profound Galaxies,\\r\\n  At that grand \\'Right hand\\'!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nA SYLLABLE.\\r\\n\\r\\nCould mortal lip divine\\r\\n  The undeveloped freight\\r\\nOf a delivered syllable,\\r\\n  \\'T would crumble with the weight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nPARTING.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy life closed twice before its close;\\r\\n  It yet remains to see\\r\\nIf Immortality unveil\\r\\n  A third event to me,\\r\\n\\r\\nSo huge, so hopeless to conceive,\\r\\n  As these that twice befell.\\r\\nParting is all we know of heaven,\\r\\n  And all we need of hell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nASPIRATION.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe never know how high we are\\r\\n  Till we are called to rise;\\r\\nAnd then, if we are true to plan,\\r\\n  Our statures touch the skies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heroism we recite\\r\\n  Would be a daily thing,\\r\\nDid not ourselves the cubits warp\\r\\n  For fear to be a king.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXV.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE INEVITABLE.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I was fearing it, it came,\\r\\n  But came with less of fear,\\r\\nBecause that fearing it so long\\r\\n  Had almost made it dear.\\r\\nThere is a fitting a dismay,\\r\\n  A fitting a despair.\\r\\n\\'Tis harder knowing it is due,\\r\\n  Than knowing it is here.\\r\\nThe trying on the utmost,\\r\\n  The morning it is new,\\r\\nIs terribler than wearing it\\r\\n  A whole existence through.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nA BOOK.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no frigate like a book\\r\\n  To take us lands away,\\r\\nNor any coursers like a page\\r\\n  Of prancing poetry.\\r\\nThis traverse may the poorest take\\r\\n  Without oppress of toll;\\r\\nHow frugal is the chariot\\r\\n  That bears a human soul!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho has not found the heaven below\\r\\n  Will fail of it above.\\r\\nGod\\'s residence is next to mine,\\r\\n  His furniture is love.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nA PORTRAIT.\\r\\n\\r\\nA face devoid of love or grace,\\r\\n  A hateful, hard, successful face,\\r\\nA face with which a stone\\r\\n  Would feel as thoroughly at ease\\r\\nAs were they old acquaintances, --\\r\\n  First time together thrown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nI HAD A GUINEA GOLDEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a guinea golden;\\r\\n  I lost it in the sand,\\r\\nAnd though the sum was simple,\\r\\n  And pounds were in the land,\\r\\nStill had it such a value\\r\\n  Unto my frugal eye,\\r\\nThat when I could not find it\\r\\n  I sat me down to sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a crimson robin\\r\\n  Who sang full many a day,\\r\\nBut when the woods were painted\\r\\n  He, too, did fly away.\\r\\nTime brought me other robins, --\\r\\n  Their ballads were the same, --\\r\\nStill for my missing troubadour\\r\\n  I kept the \\'house at hame.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a star in heaven;\\r\\n  One Pleiad was its name,\\r\\nAnd when I was not heeding\\r\\n  It wandered from the same.\\r\\nAnd though the skies are crowded,\\r\\n  And all the night ashine,\\r\\nI do not care about it,\\r\\n  Since none of them are mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy story has a moral:\\r\\n  I have a missing friend, --\\r\\nPleiad its name, and robin,\\r\\n  And guinea in the sand, --\\r\\nAnd when this mournful ditty,\\r\\n  Accompanied with tear,\\r\\nShall meet the eye of traitor\\r\\n  In country far from here,\\r\\nGrant that repentance solemn\\r\\n  May seize upon his mind,\\r\\nAnd he no consolation\\r\\n  Beneath the sun may find.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE. -- This poem may have had, like many others, a\\r\\npersonal origin. It is more than probable that it was\\r\\nsent to some friend travelling in Europe, a dainty\\r\\nreminder of letter-writing delinquencies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXX.\\r\\n\\r\\nSATURDAY AFTERNOON.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom all the jails the boys and girls\\r\\n  Ecstatically leap, --\\r\\nBeloved, only afternoon\\r\\n  That prison doesn\\'t keep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey storm the earth and stun the air,\\r\\n  A mob of solid bliss.\\r\\nAlas! that frowns could lie in wait\\r\\n  For such a foe as this!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nFew get enough, -- enough is one;\\r\\n  To that ethereal throng\\r\\nHave not each one of us the right\\r\\n  To stealthily belong?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the gallows hung a wretch,\\r\\n  Too sullied for the hell\\r\\nTo which the law entitled him.\\r\\n  As nature\\'s curtain fell\\r\\nThe one who bore him tottered in,\\r\\n  For this was woman\\'s son.\\r\\n\\'\\'T was all I had,\\' she stricken gasped;\\r\\n  Oh, what a livid boon!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LOST THOUGHT.\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt a clearing in my mind\\r\\n  As if my brain had split;\\r\\nI tried to match it, seam by seam,\\r\\n  But could not make them fit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought behind I strove to join\\r\\n  Unto the thought before,\\r\\nBut sequence ravelled out of reach\\r\\n  Like balls upon a floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nRETICENCE.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reticent volcano keeps\\r\\n  His never slumbering plan;\\r\\nConfided are his projects pink\\r\\n  To no precarious man.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf nature will not tell the tale\\r\\n  Jehovah told to her,\\r\\nCan human nature not survive\\r\\n  Without a listener?\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmonished by her buckled lips\\r\\n  Let every babbler be.\\r\\nThe only secret people keep\\r\\n  Is Immortality.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXV.\\r\\n\\r\\nWITH FLOWERS.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf recollecting were forgetting,\\r\\n  Then I remember not;\\r\\nAnd if forgetting, recollecting,\\r\\n  How near I had forgot!\\r\\nAnd if to miss were merry,\\r\\n  And if to mourn were gay,\\r\\nHow very blithe the fingers\\r\\n  That gathered these to-day!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farthest thunder that I heard\\r\\n  Was nearer than the sky,\\r\\nAnd rumbles still, though torrid noons\\r\\n  Have lain their missiles by.\\r\\nThe lightning that preceded it\\r\\n  Struck no one but myself,\\r\\nBut I would not exchange the bolt\\r\\n  For all the rest of life.\\r\\nIndebtedness to oxygen\\r\\n  The chemist may repay,\\r\\nBut not the obligation\\r\\n  To electricity.\\r\\nIt founds the homes and decks the days,\\r\\n  And every clamor bright\\r\\nIs but the gleam concomitant\\r\\n  Of that waylaying light.\\r\\nThe thought is quiet as a flake, --\\r\\n  A crash without a sound;\\r\\nHow life\\'s reverberation\\r\\n  Its explanation found!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the bleakness of my lot\\r\\n  Bloom I strove to raise.\\r\\nLate, my acre of a rock\\r\\n  Yielded grape and maize.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoil of flint if steadfast tilled\\r\\n  Will reward the hand;\\r\\nSeed of palm by Lybian sun\\r\\n  Fructified in sand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nCONTRAST.\\r\\n\\r\\nA door just opened on a street --\\r\\n  I, lost, was passing by --\\r\\nAn instant\\'s width of warmth disclosed,\\r\\n  And wealth, and company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door as sudden shut, and I,\\r\\n  I, lost, was passing by, --\\r\\nLost doubly, but by contrast most,\\r\\n  Enlightening misery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIENDS.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre friends delight or pain?\\r\\n  Could bounty but remain\\r\\nRiches were good.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if they only stay\\r\\nBolder to fly away,\\r\\n  Riches are sad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXX.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRE.\\r\\n\\r\\nAshes denote that fire was;\\r\\n  Respect the grayest pile\\r\\nFor the departed creature\\'s sake\\r\\n  That hovered there awhile.\\r\\n\\r\\nFire exists the first in light,\\r\\n  And then consolidates, --\\r\\nOnly the chemist can disclose\\r\\n  Into what carbonates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nA MAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nFate slew him, but he did not drop;\\r\\n  She felled -- he did not fall --\\r\\nImpaled him on her fiercest stakes --\\r\\n  He neutralized them all.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stung him, sapped his firm advance,\\r\\n  But, when her worst was done,\\r\\nAnd he, unmoved, regarded her,\\r\\n  Acknowledged him a man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nVENTURES.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinite to fail, but infinite to venture.\\r\\n  For the one ship that struts the shore\\r\\nMany\\'s the gallant, overwhelmed creature\\r\\n  Nodding in navies nevermore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nGRIEFS.\\r\\n\\r\\nI measure every grief I meet\\r\\n  With analytic eyes;\\r\\nI wonder if it weighs like mine,\\r\\n  Or has an easier size.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wonder if they bore it long,\\r\\n  Or did it just begin?\\r\\nI could not tell the date of mine,\\r\\n  It feels so old a pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wonder if it hurts to live,\\r\\n  And if they have to try,\\r\\nAnd whether, could they choose between,\\r\\n  They would not rather die.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wonder if when years have piled --\\r\\n  Some thousands -- on the cause\\r\\nOf early hurt, if such a lapse\\r\\n  Could give them any pause;\\r\\n\\r\\nOr would they go on aching still\\r\\n  Through centuries above,\\r\\nEnlightened to a larger pain\\r\\n  By contrast with the love.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grieved are many, I am told;\\r\\n  The reason deeper lies, --\\r\\nDeath is but one and comes but once,\\r\\n  And only nails the eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s grief of want, and grief of cold, --\\r\\n  A sort they call \\'despair;\\'\\r\\nThere\\'s banishment from native eyes,\\r\\n  In sight of native air.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd though I may not guess the kind\\r\\n  Correctly, yet to me\\r\\nA piercing comfort it affords\\r\\n  In passing Calvary,\\r\\n\\r\\nTo note the fashions of the cross,\\r\\n  Of those that stand alone,\\r\\nStill fascinated to presume\\r\\n  That some are like my own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a king who does not speak;\\r\\nSo, wondering, thro\\' the hours meek\\r\\n  I trudge the day away,--\\r\\nHalf glad when it is night and sleep,\\r\\nIf, haply, thro\\' a dream to peep\\r\\n  In parlors shut by day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if I do, when morning comes,\\r\\nIt is as if a hundred drums\\r\\n  Did round my pillow roll,\\r\\nAnd shouts fill all my childish sky,\\r\\nAnd bells keep saying \\'victory\\'\\r\\n  From steeples in my soul!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if I don\\'t, the little Bird\\r\\nWithin the Orchard is not heard,\\r\\n  And I omit to pray,\\r\\n\\'Father, thy will be done\\' to-day,\\r\\nFor my will goes the other

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\r\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\r\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\\r\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and official\\r\\npage at http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\r\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\\'s\\r\\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\\r\\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\\r\\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\\r\\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\\r\\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\\r\\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\\r\\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\\r\\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\\r\\ndownload by the etext year. For example:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06\\r\\n\\r\\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\\r\\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\\r\\n\\r\\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\\r\\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\\r\\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\\r\\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\\r\\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\\r\\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\\r\\n\\r\\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\\r\\n\\r\\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

HIGGINSON\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE\\n\\nThe eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson\\'s\\npoems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern\\nartificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the\\nqualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest\\nthemes,--life and love and death. That \"irresistible needle-touch,\"\\nas one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very\\ncore of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as\\nit has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling\\npower.  This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to\\nform with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties.\\n\\nAlthough Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending\\noccasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of\\nher writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend \"H.H.\"\\nmust at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th\\nSeptember, 1884, she wrote:--\\n\\n\\nMY DEAR FRIEND,-- What portfolios full of verses\\nyou must have! It is a cruel wrong to your \"day and\\ngeneration\" that you will not give them light.\\n\\nIf such a thing should happen as that I should outlive\\nyou, I wish you would make me your literary legatee\\nand executor. Surely after you are what is called\\n\"dead\" you will be willing that the poor ghosts you\\nhave left behind should be cheered and pleased by your\\nverses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think\\nwe have a right to withhold from the world a word or\\na thought any more than a deed which might help a\\nsingle soul. . . .\\n\\n                Truly yours,\\n\\n                        HELEN JACKSON.\\n\\n\\nThe \"portfolios\" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson\\'s death,\\nby her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had\\nbeen carefully copied on sheets of note-paper, and tied in little\\nfascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear\\nevidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had\\nreceived thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of\\nrather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and\\nphrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one\\nform, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without\\nimportant exception, her friends have generously placed at the\\ndisposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and\\nthese have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several\\nrenderings of the same verse.\\n\\nTo what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been\\nsubjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They\\nshould be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and\\nsuggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some\\ntime in the finished picture.\\n\\nEmily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the\\nwinter of 1862. In a letter to oone of the present Editors the\\nApril following, she says, \"I made no verse, but one or two, until\\nthis winter.\"\\n\\nThe handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running\\nItalian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in\\nbreadth of thought, it grew bolder and more abrupt, until in her\\nlatest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its\\nfellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones,\\neverything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous\\ndashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of\\na page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and\\nstrong.  The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of\\nthe earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date,\\nthe handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general\\nchronologic accuracy.\\n\\nAs a rule, the verses were without titles; but \"A Country Burial,\"\\n\"A Thunder-Storm,\" \"The Humming-Bird,\" and a few others were named\\nby their author, frequently at the end,--sometimes only in the\\naccompanying note, if sent to a friend.\\n\\nThe variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in\\npencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of\\nresponsibility upon her Editors. But all interference not\\nabsolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her\\nrendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it\\nseems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and\\nmore usual rhymes.\\n\\nLike impressionist pictures, or Wagner\\'s rugged music, the very\\nabsence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily\\nDickinson\\'s exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic fitness of a\\nparticular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything\\nvirtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of\\ninner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, and\\nthe \"thought-rhyme\" appears frequently,--appealing, indeed, to an\\nunrecognized sense more elusive than hearing.\\n\\nEmily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness.\\nEvery subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the\\nsombre facts of death and burial, and the unknown life beyond. She\\ntouches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost\\nhumorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is\\nnever by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critic\\nhas said, she may exhibit toward God \"an Emersonian self-possession,\"\\nit was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced\\nas it is rare.\\n\\nShe had tried society and the world, and found them lacking.  She\\nwas not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no\\nlove-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming of a nature\\nintrospective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist\\nin pretence.\\n\\nStorm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and\\nbees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted\\nhuman friends, were sufficient companionship. The coming of the\\nfirst robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of\\npope; the first red leaf hurrying through \"the altered air,\" an\\nepoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or\\nmelancholy, she lived in its presence.\\n\\n                                MABEL LOOMIS TODD.\\n\\n        AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS,\\n            August, I891.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    My nosegays are for captives;\\n       Dim, long-expectant eyes,\\n    Fingers denied the plucking,\\n       Patient till paradise,\\n\\n    To such, if they should whisper\\n       Of morning and the moor,\\n    They bear no other errand,\\n       And I, no other prayer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI.

warm\\nThe bosoms where the frost has lain\\nAges beneath the mould.\\n\\nSome other thirsty there may be\\nTo whom this would have pointed me\\nHad it remained to speak.\\n\\nAnd so I always bear the

the birds,\\nPathetic from the grass,\\nA minor nation celebrates\\nIts unobtrusive mass.\\n\\nNo ordinance is seen,\\nSo gradual the grace,\\nA pensive custom it becomes,\\nEnlarging loneliness.\\n\\nAntiquest felt at noon\\nWhen August, burning low,\\nCalls forth this spectral canticle,\\nRepose to typify.\\n\\nRemit as yet no grace,\\nNo furrow on the glow,\\nYet a druidic difference\\nEnhances nature now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXLV.\\n\\nAs imperceptibly as grief\\nThe summer lapsed away, --\\nToo imperceptible, at last,\\nTo seem like perfidy.\\n\\nA quietness distilled,\\nAs twilight long begun,\\nOr Nature, spending with herself\\nSequestered afternoon.\\n\\nThe dusk drew earlier in,\\nThe morning foreign shone, --\\nA courteous, yet harrowing grace,\\nAs guest who would be gone.\\n\\nAnd thus, without a wing,\\nOr service of a keel,\\nOur summer made her light escape\\nInto the beautiful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXLVI.\\n\\nIt can\\'t be summer, -- that got through;\\nIt \\'s early yet for spring;\\nThere \\'s that long town of white to cross\\nBefore the blackbirds sing.\\n\\nIt can\\'t be dying, -- it\\'s too rouge, --\\nThe dead shall go in white.\\nSo sunset shuts my question down\\nWith clasps of chrysolite.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXLVII.\\n\\nSUMMER\\'S OBSEQUIES.\\n\\nThe gentian weaves her fringes,\\nThe maple\\'s loom is red.\\nMy departing blossoms\\nObviate parade.\\n\\nA brief, but patient illness,\\nAn hour to prepare;\\nAnd one, below this morning,\\nIs where the angels are.\\n\\nIt was a short procession, --\\nThe bobolink was there,\\nAn aged bee addressed us,\\nAnd then we knelt in prayer.\\n\\nWe trust that she was willing, --\\nWe ask that we may be.\\nSummer, sister, seraph,\\nLet us go with thee!\\n\\nIn the name of the bee\\nAnd of the butterfly\\nAnd of the breeze, amen!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXLVIII.\\n\\nFRINGED GENTIAN.\\n\\nGod made a little gentian;\\nIt tried to be a rose\\nAnd failed, and all the summer laughed.\\nBut just before the snows\\nThere came a purple creature\\nThat ravished all the hill;\\nAnd summer hid her forehead,\\nAnd mockery was still.\\nThe frosts were her condition;\\nThe Tyrian would not come\\nUntil the North evoked it.\\n\"Creator! shall I bloom?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXLIX.\\n\\nNOVEMBER.\\n\\nBesides the autumn poets sing,\\nA few prosaic days\\nA little this side of the snow\\nAnd that side of the haze.\\n\\nA few incisive mornings,\\nA few ascetic eyes, --\\nGone Mr. Bryant\\'s golden-rod,\\nAnd Mr. Thomson\\'s sheaves.\\n\\nStill is the bustle in the brook,\\nSealed are the spicy valves;\\nMesmeric fingers softly touch\\nThe eyes of many elves.\\n\\nPerhaps a squirrel may remain,\\nMy sentiments to share.\\nGrant me, O Lord, a sunny mind,\\nThy windy will to bear!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nL.\\n\\nTHE SNOW.\\n\\nIt sifts from leaden sieves,\\nIt powders all the wood,\\nIt fills with alabaster wool\\nThe wrinkles of the road.\\n\\nIt makes an even face\\nOf mountain and of plain, --\\nUnbroken forehead from the east\\nUnto the east again.\\n\\nIt reaches to the fence,\\nIt wraps it, rail by rail,\\nTill it is lost in fleeces;\\nIt flings a crystal veil\\n\\nOn stump and stack and stem, --\\nThe summer\\'s empty room,\\nAcres of seams where harvests were,\\nRecordless, but for them.\\n\\nIt ruffles wrists of posts,\\nAs ankles of a queen, --\\nThen stills its artisans like ghosts,\\nDenying they have been.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLI.\\n\\nTHE BLUE JAY.\\n\\nNo brigadier throughout the year\\nSo civic as the jay.\\nA neighbor and a warrior too,\\nWith shrill felicity\\n\\nPursuing winds that censure us\\nA February day,\\nThe brother of the universe\\nWas never blown away.\\n\\nThe snow and he are intimate;\\nI \\'ve often seen them play\\nWhen heaven looked upon us all\\nWith such severity,\\n\\nI felt apology were due\\nTo an insulted sky,\\nWhose pompous frown was nutriment\\nTo their temerity.\\n\\nThe pillow of this daring head\\nIs pungent evergreens;\\nHis larder -- terse and militant --\\nUnknown, refreshing things;\\n\\nHis character a tonic,\\nHis future a dispute;\\nUnfair an immortality\\nThat leaves this neighbor out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV. TIME AND ETERNITY.\\n\\n\\nI.\\n\\nLet down the bars, O Death!\\nThe tired flocks come in\\nWhose bleating ceases to repeat,\\nWhose wandering is done.\\n\\nThine is the stillest night,\\nThine the securest fold;\\nToo near thou art for seeking thee,\\nToo tender to be told.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII.\\n\\nGoing to heaven!\\nI don\\'t know when,\\nPray do not ask me how, --\\nIndeed, I \\'m too astonished\\nTo think of answering you!\\nGoing to heaven! --\\nHow dim it sounds!\\nAnd yet it will be done\\nAs sure as flocks go home at night\\nUnto the shepherd\\'s arm!\\n\\nPerhaps you \\'re going too!\\nWho knows?\\nIf you should get there first,\\nSave just a little place for me\\nClose to the two I lost!\\n\\nThe smallest \"robe\" will fit me,\\nAnd just a bit of \"crown;\"\\nFor you know we do not mind our dress\\nWhen we are going home.\\n\\nI \\'m glad I don\\'t believe it,\\nFor it would stop my breath,\\nAnd I \\'d like to look a little more\\nAt such a curious earth!\\nI am glad they did believe it\\nWhom I have never found\\nSince the mighty autumn afternoon\\nI left them in the ground.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nAt least to pray is left, is left.\\nO Jesus! in the air\\nI know not which thy chamber is, --\\nI \\'m knocking everywhere.\\n\\nThou stirrest earthquake in the South,\\nAnd maelstrom in the sea;\\nSay, Jesus Christ of Nazareth,\\nHast thou no arm for me?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV.\\n\\nEPITAPH.\\n\\nStep lightly on this narrow spot!\\nThe broadest land that grows\\nIs not so ample as the breast\\nThese emerald seams enclose.\\n\\nStep lofty; for this name is told\\nAs far as cannon dwell,\\nOr flag subsist, or fame export\\nHer deathless syllable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV.\\n\\nMorns like these we parted;\\nNoons like these she rose,\\nFluttering first, then firmer,\\nTo her fair repose.\\n\\nNever did she lisp it,\\nAnd \\'t was not for me;\\nShe was mute from transport,\\nI, from agony!\\n\\nTill the evening, nearing,\\nOne the shutters drew --\\nQuick! a sharper rustling!\\nAnd this linnet flew!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI.\\n\\nA death-blow is a life-blow to some\\nWho, till they died, did not alive become;\\nWho, had they lived, had died, but when\\nThey died, vitality begun.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII.\\n\\nI read my sentence steadily,\\nReviewed it with my eyes,\\nTo see that I made no mistake\\nIn its extremest clause, --\\n\\nThe date, and manner of the shame;\\nAnd then the pious form\\nThat \"God have mercy\" on the soul\\nThe jury voted him.\\n\\nI made my soul familiar\\nWith her extremity,\\nThat at the last it should not be\\nA novel agony,\\n\\nBut she and Death, acquainted,\\nMeet tranquilly as friends,\\nSalute and pass without a hint --\\nAnd there the matter ends.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII.\\n\\nI have not told my garden yet,\\nLest that should conquer me;\\nI have not quite the strength now\\nTo break it to the bee.\\n\\nI will not name it in the street,\\nFor shops would stare, that I,\\nSo shy, so very ignorant,\\nShould have the face to die.\\n\\nThe hillsides must not know it,\\nWhere I have rambled so,\\nNor tell the loving forests\\nThe day that I shall go,\\n\\nNor lisp it at the table,\\nNor heedless by the way\\nHint that within the riddle\\nOne will walk to-day!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX.\\n\\nTHE BATTLE-FIELD.\\n\\nThey dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars,\\n   Like petals from a rose,\\nWhen suddenly across the June\\n   A wind with fingers goes.\\n\\nThey perished in the seamless grass, --\\n   No eye could find the place;\\nBut God on his repealless list\\n   Can summon every face.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX.\\n\\nThe only ghost I ever saw\\nWas dressed in mechlin, -- so;\\nHe wore no sandal on his foot,\\nAnd stepped like flakes of snow.\\nHis gait was soundless, like the bird,\\nBut rapid, like the roe;\\nHis fashions quaint, mosaic,\\nOr, haply, mistletoe.\\n\\nHis conversation seldom,\\nHis laughter like the breeze\\nThat dies away in dimples\\nAmong the pensive trees.\\nOur interview was transient,--\\nOf me, himself was shy;\\nAnd God forbid I look behind\\nSince that appalling day!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXI.\\n\\nSome, too fragile for winter winds,\\nThe thoughtful grave encloses, --\\nTenderly tucking them in from frost\\nBefore their feet are cold.\\n\\nNever the treasures in her nest\\nThe cautious grave exposes,\\nBuilding where schoolboy dare not look\\nAnd sportsman is not bold.\\n\\nThis covert have all the children\\nEarly aged, and often cold, --\\nSparrows unnoticed by the Father;\\nLambs for whom time had not a fold.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXII.\\n\\nAs by the dead we love to sit,\\nBecome so wondrous dear,\\nAs for the lost we grapple,\\nThough all the rest are here, --\\n\\nIn broken mathematics\\nWe estimate our prize,\\nVast, in its fading ratio,\\nTo our penurious eyes!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIII.\\n\\nMEMORIALS.\\n\\nDeath sets a thing significant\\nThe eye had hurried by,\\nExcept a perished creature\\nEntreat us tenderly\\n\\nTo ponder little workmanships\\nIn crayon or in wool,\\nWith \"This was last her fingers did,\"\\nIndustrious until\\n\\nThe thimble weighed too heavy,\\nThe stitches stopped themselves,\\nAnd then \\'t was put among the dust\\nUpon the closet shelves.\\n\\nA book I have, a friend gave,\\nWhose pencil, here and there,\\nHad notched the place that pleased him, --\\nAt rest his fingers are.\\n\\nNow, when I read, I read not,\\nFor interrupting tears\\nObliterate the etchings\\nToo costly for repairs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIV.\\n\\nI went to heaven, --\\n\\'T was a small town,\\nLit with a ruby,\\nLathed with down.\\nStiller than the fields\\nAt the full dew,\\nBeautiful as pictures\\nNo man drew.\\nPeople like the moth,\\nOf mechlin, frames,\\nDuties of gossamer,\\nAnd eider names.\\nAlmost contented\\nI could be\\n\\'Mong such unique\\nSociety.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXV.\\n\\nTheir height in heaven comforts not,\\nTheir glory nought to me;\\n\\'T was best imperfect, as it was;\\nI \\'m finite, I can\\'t see.\\n\\nThe house of supposition,\\nThe glimmering frontier\\nThat skirts the acres of perhaps,\\nTo me shows insecure.\\n\\nThe wealth I had contented me;\\nIf \\'t was a meaner size,\\nThen I had counted it until\\nIt pleased my narrow eyes\\n\\nBetter than larger values,\\nHowever true their show;\\nThis timid life of evidence\\nKeeps pleading, \"I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVI.\\n\\nThere is a shame of nobleness\\nConfronting sudden pelf, --\\nA finer shame of ecstasy\\nConvicted of itself.\\n\\nA best disgrace a brave man feels,\\nAcknowledged of the brave, --\\nOne more \"Ye Blessed\" to be told;\\nBut this involves the grave.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVII.\\n\\nTRIUMPH.\\n\\nTriumph may be of several kinds.\\nThere \\'s triumph in the room\\nWhen that old imperator, Death,\\nBy faith is overcome.\\n\\nThere \\'s triumph of the finer mind\\nWhen truth, affronted long,\\nAdvances calm to her supreme,\\nHer God her only throng.\\n\\nA triumph when temptation\\'s bribe\\nIs slowly handed back,\\nOne eye upon the heaven renounced\\nAnd one upon the rack.\\n\\nSeverer triumph, by himself\\nExperienced, who can pass\\nAcquitted from that naked bar,\\nJehovah\\'s countenance!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVIII.\\n\\nPompless no life can pass away;\\n    The lowliest career\\nTo the same pageant wends its way\\n    As that exalted here.\\nHow cordial is the mystery!\\n    The hospitable pall\\nA \"this way\" beckons spaciously, --\\n    A miracle for all!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIX.\\n\\nI noticed people disappeared,\\nWhen but a little child, --\\nSupposed they visited remote,\\nOr settled regions wild.\\n\\nNow know I they both visited\\nAnd settled regions wild,\\nBut did because they died, -- a fact\\nWithheld the little child!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXX.\\n\\nFOLLOWING.\\n\\nI had no cause to be awake,\\nMy best was gone to sleep,\\nAnd morn a new politeness took,\\nAnd failed to wake them up,\\n\\nBut called the others clear,\\nAnd passed their curtains by.\\nSweet morning, when I over-sleep,\\nKnock, recollect, for me!\\n\\nI looked at sunrise once,\\nAnd then I looked at them,\\nAnd wishfulness in me arose\\nFor circumstance the same.\\n\\n\\'T was such an ample peace,\\nIt could not hold a sigh, --\\n\\'T was Sabbath with the bells divorced,\\n\\'T was sunset all the day.\\n\\nSo choosing but a gown\\nAnd taking but a prayer,\\nThe only raiment I should need,\\nI struggled, and was there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXI.\\n\\nIf anybody\\'s friend be dead,\\nIt \\'s sharpest of the theme\\nThe thinking how they walked alive,\\nAt such and such a time.\\n\\nTheir costume, of a Sunday,\\nSome manner of the hair, --\\nA prank nobody knew but them,\\nLost, in the sepulchre.\\n\\nHow warm they were on such a day:\\nYou almost feel the date,\\nSo short way off it seems; and now,\\nThey \\'re centuries from that.\\n\\nHow pleased they were at what you said;\\nYou try to touch the smile,\\nAnd dip your fingers in the frost:\\nWhen was it, can you tell,\\n\\nYou asked the company to tea,\\nAcquaintance, just a few,\\nAnd chatted close with this grand thing\\nThat don\\'t remember you?\\n\\nPast bows and invitations,\\nPast interview, and vow,\\nPast what ourselves can estimate, --\\nThat makes the quick of woe!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXII.\\n\\nTHE JOURNEY.\\n\\nOur journey had advanced;\\nOur feet were almost come\\nTo that odd fork in Being\\'s road,\\nEternity by term.\\n\\nOur pace took sudden awe,\\nOur feet reluctant led.\\nBefore were cities, but between,\\nThe forest of the dead.\\n\\nRetreat was out of hope, --\\nBehind, a sealed route,\\nEternity\\'s white flag before,\\nAnd God at every gate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIII.\\n\\nA COUNTRY BURIAL.\\n\\nAmple make this bed.\\nMake this bed with awe;\\nIn it wait till judgment break\\nExcellent and fair.\\n\\nBe its mattress straight,\\nBe its pillow round;\\nLet no sunrise\\' yellow noise\\nInterrupt this ground.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIV.\\n\\nGOING.\\n\\nOn such a night, or such a night,\\nWould anybody care\\nIf such a little figure\\nSlipped quiet from its chair,\\n\\nSo quiet, oh, how quiet!\\nThat nobody might know\\nBut that the little figure\\nRocked softer, to and fro?\\n\\nOn such a dawn, or such a dawn,\\nWould anybody sigh\\nThat such a little figure\\nToo sound asleep did lie\\n\\nFor chanticleer to wake it, --\\nOr stirring house below,\\nOr giddy bird in orchard,\\nOr early task to do?\\n\\nThere was a little figure plump\\nFor every little knoll,\\nBusy needles, and spools of thread,\\nAnd trudging feet from school.\\n\\nPlaymates, and holidays, and nuts,\\nAnd visions vast and small.\\nStrange that the feet so precious charged\\nShould reach so small a goal!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXV.\\n\\nEssential oils are wrung:\\nThe attar from the rose\\nIs not expressed by suns alone,\\nIt is the gift of screws.\\n\\nThe general rose decays;\\nBut this, in lady\\'s drawer,\\nMakes summer when the lady lies\\nIn ceaseless rosemary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVI.\\n\\nI lived on dread; to those who know\\nThe stimulus there is\\nIn danger, other impetus\\nIs numb and vital-less.\\n\\nAs \\'t were a spur upon the soul,\\nA fear will urge it where\\nTo go without the spectre\\'s aid\\nWere challenging despair.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVII.\\n\\nIf I should die,\\nAnd you should live,\\nAnd time should gurgle on,\\nAnd morn should beam,\\nAnd noon should burn,\\nAs it has usual done;\\nIf birds should build as early,\\nAnd bees as bustling go, --\\nOne might depart at option\\nFrom enterprise below!\\n\\'T is sweet to know that stocks will stand\\nWhen we with daisies lie,\\nThat commerce will continue,\\nAnd trades as briskly fly.\\nIt makes the parting tranquil\\nAnd keeps the soul serene,\\nThat gentlemen so sprightly\\nConduct the pleasing scene!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVIII.\\n\\nAT LENGTH.\\n\\nHer final summer was it,\\nAnd yet we guessed it not;\\nIf tenderer industriousness\\nPervaded her, we thought\\n\\nA further force of life\\nDeveloped from within, --\\nWhen Death lit all the shortness up,\\nAnd made the hurry plain.\\n\\nWe wondered at our blindness, --\\nWhen nothing was to see\\nBut her Carrara guide-post, --\\nAt our stupidity,\\n\\nWhen, duller than our dulness,\\nThe busy darling lay,\\nSo busy was she, finishing,\\nSo leisurely were we!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIX.\\n\\nGHOSTS.\\n\\nOne need not be a chamber to be haunted,\\nOne need not be a house;\\nThe brain has corridors surpassing\\nMaterial place.\\n\\nFar safer, of a midnight meeting\\nExternal ghost,\\nThan an interior confronting\\nThat whiter host.\\n\\nFar safer through an Abbey gallop,\\nThe stones achase,\\nThan, moonless, one\\'s own self encounter\\nIn lonesome place.\\n\\nOurself, behind ourself concealed,\\nShould startle most;\\nAssassin, hid in our apartment,\\nBe horror\\'s least.\\n\\nThe prudent carries a revolver,\\nHe bolts the door,\\nO\\'erlooking a superior spectre\\nMore near.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXX.\\n\\nVANISHED.\\n\\nShe died, -- this was the way she died;\\nAnd when her breath was done,\\nTook up her simple wardrobe\\nAnd started for the sun.\\n\\nHer little figure at the gate\\nThe angels must have spied,\\nSince I could never find her\\nUpon the mortal side.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXI.\\n\\nPRECEDENCE.\\n\\nWait till the majesty of Death\\nInvests so mean a brow!\\nAlmost a powdered footman\\nMight dare to touch it now!\\n\\nWait till in everlasting robes\\nThis democrat is dressed,\\nThen prate about \"preferment\"\\nAnd \"station\" and the rest!\\n\\nAround this quiet courtier\\nObsequious angels wait!\\nFull royal is his retinue,\\nFull purple is his state!\\n\\nA lord might dare to lift the hat\\nTo such a modest clay,\\nSince that my Lord, \"the Lord of lords\"\\nReceives unblushingly!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXII.\\n\\nGONE.\\n\\nWent up a year this evening!\\nI recollect it well!\\nAmid no bells nor bravos\\nThe bystanders will tell!\\nCheerful, as to the village,\\nTranquil, as to repose,\\nChastened, as to the chapel,\\nThis humble tourist rose.\\nDid not talk of returning,\\nAlluded to no time\\nWhen, were the gales propitious,\\nWe might look for him;\\nWas grateful for the roses\\nIn life\\'s diverse bouquet,\\nTalked softly of new species\\nTo pick another day.\\n\\nBeguiling thus the wonder,\\nThe wondrous nearer drew;\\nHands bustled at the moorings --\\nThe crowd respectful grew.\\nAscended from our vision\\nTo countenances new!\\nA difference, a daisy,\\nIs all the rest I knew!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXIII.\\n\\nREQUIEM.\\n\\nTaken from men this morning,\\nCarried by men to-day,\\nMet by the gods with banners\\nWho marshalled her away.\\n\\nOne little maid from playmates,\\nOne little mind from school, --\\nThere must be guests in Eden;\\nAll the rooms are full.\\n\\nFar as the east from even,\\nDim as the border star, --\\nCourtiers quaint, in kingdoms,\\nOur departed are.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXIV.\\n\\nWhat inn is this\\nWhere for the night\\nPeculiar traveller comes?\\nWho is the landlord?\\nWhere the maids?\\nBehold, what curious rooms!\\nNo ruddy fires on the hearth,\\nNo brimming tankards flow.\\nNecromancer, landlord,\\nWho are these below?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXV.\\n\\nIt was not death, for I stood up,\\nAnd all the dead lie down;\\nIt was not night, for all the bells\\nPut out their tongues, for noon.\\n\\nIt was not frost, for on my flesh\\nI felt siroccos crawl, --\\nNor fire, for just my marble feet\\nCould keep a chancel cool.\\n\\nAnd yet it tasted like them all;\\nThe figures I have seen\\nSet orderly, for burial,\\nReminded me of mine,\\n\\nAs if my life were shaven\\nAnd fitted to a frame,\\nAnd could not breathe without a key;\\nAnd \\'t was like midnight, some,\\n\\nWhen everything that ticked has stopped,\\nAnd space stares, all around,\\nOr grisly frosts, first autumn morns,\\nRepeal the beating ground.\\n\\nBut most like chaos, -- stopless, cool, --\\nWithout a chance or spar,\\nOr even a report of land\\nTo justify despair.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXVI.\\n\\nTILL THE END.\\n\\nI should not dare to leave my friend,\\nBecause -- because if he should die\\nWhile I was gone, and I -- too late --\\nShould reach the heart that wanted me;\\n\\nIf I should disappoint the eyes\\nThat hunted, hunted so, to see,\\nAnd could not bear to shut until\\nThey \"noticed\" me -- they noticed me;\\n\\nIf I should stab the patient faith\\nSo sure I \\'d come -- so sure I \\'d come,\\nIt listening, listening, went to sleep\\nTelling my tardy name, --\\n\\nMy heart would wish it broke before,\\nSince breaking then, since breaking then,\\nWere useless as next morning\\'s sun,\\nWhere midnight frosts had lain!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXVII.\\n\\nVOID.\\n\\nGreat streets of silence led away\\nTo neighborhoods of pause;\\nHere was no notice, no dissent,\\nNo universe, no laws.\\n\\nBy clocks \\'t was morning, and for night\\nThe bells at distance called;\\nBut epoch had no basis here,\\nFor period exhaled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXVIII.\\n\\nA throe upon the features\\nA hurry in the breath,\\nAn ecstasy of parting\\nDenominated \"Death,\" --\\n\\nAn anguish at the mention,\\nWhich, when to patience grown,\\nI \\'ve known permission given\\nTo rejoin its own.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXIX.\\n\\nSAVED!\\n\\nOf tribulation these are they\\nDenoted by the white;\\nThe spangled gowns, a lesser rank\\nOf

soil;\\nDefeat, an outgrown anguish,\\nRemembered as the mile\\n\\nOur panting ankle barely gained\\nWhen night devoured the road;\\nBut we stood whispering in the house,\\nAnd all we said was \"Saved\"!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXL.\\n\\nI think just how my shape will rise\\nWhen I shall be forgiven,\\nTill hair and eyes and timid head\\nAre out of sight, in heaven.\\n\\nI think just how my lips

EMILY DICKINSON\\n\\nThird Series\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEdited by\\n\\nMABEL LOOMIS TODD\\n\\n\\n\\n    It\\'s all I have to bring to-day,\\n      This, and my heart beside,\\n    This, and my heart, and all the fields,\\n      And all the meadows wide.\\n    Be sure you count, should I forget, --\\n      Some one the sum could tell, --\\n    This, and my heart, and all the bees\\n      Which in the clover dwell.\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE.\\n\\nThe intellectual activity of Emily Dickinson was so great that\\na large and characteristic choice is still possible among her\\nliterary material, and this third volume of her verses is put\\nforth in response to the repeated wish of the admirers of her\\npeculiar genius. Much of Emily Dickinson\\'s prose was rhythmic,\\n--even rhymed, though frequently not set apart in lines.\\n\\nAlso many verses, written as such, were sent to friends in\\nletters; these were published in 1894, in the volumes of her\\n_Letters_. It has not been necessary, however, to include them in\\nthis Series, and all have been omitted, except three or four\\nexceptionally strong ones, as \"A Book,\" and \"With Flowers.\"\\n\\nThere is internal evidence that many of the poems were simply\\nspontaneous flashes of insight, apparently unrelated to outward\\ncircumstance. Others, however, had an obvious personal origin;\\nfor example, the verses \"I had a Guinea golden,\" which seem to\\nhave been sent to some friend travelling in Europe, as a dainty\\nreminder of letter-writing delinquencies. The surroundings in\\nwhich any of Emily Dickinson\\'s verses are known to have been\\nwritten usually serve to explain them clearly; but in general the\\npresent volume is full of thoughts needing no interpretation to\\nthose who apprehend this scintillating spirit.\\n\\n                                        M. L. T.\\n\\nAMHERST, _October_, 1896.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI. LIFE.\\n\\n\\nI.\\n\\nREAL RICHES.\\n\\n\\'T is little I could care for pearls\\n  Who own the ample sea;\\nOr brooches, when the Emperor\\n  With rubies pelteth me;\\n\\nOr gold, who am the Prince of Mines;\\n  Or diamonds, when I see\\nA diadem to fit a dome\\n  Continual crowning me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII.\\n\\nSUPERIORITY TO FATE.\\n\\nSuperiority to fate\\n  Is difficult to learn.\\n\\'T is not conferred by any,\\n  But possible to earn\\n\\nA pittance at a time,\\n  Until, to her surprise,\\nThe soul with strict economy\\n  Subsists till Paradise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nHOPE.\\n\\nHope is a subtle glutton;\\n  He feeds upon the fair;\\nAnd yet, inspected closely,\\n  What abstinence is there!\\n\\nHis is the halcyon table\\n  That never seats but one,\\nAnd whatsoever is consumed\\n  The same amounts remain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV.\\n\\nFORBIDDEN FRUIT.\\n\\nI.\\n\\nForbidden fruit a flavor has\\n  That lawful orchards mocks;\\nHow luscious lies the pea within\\n  The pod that Duty locks!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV.\\n\\nFORBIDDEN FRUIT.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nHeaven is what I cannot reach!\\n  The apple on the tree,\\nProvided it do hopeless hang,\\n  That \\'heaven\\' is, to me.\\n\\nThe color

me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK III\\n\\n\\nSong of Myself\\n\\n       1\\n  I celebrate myself, and sing myself,\\n  And what I assume you shall assume,\\n  For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.\\n\\n  I loafe and invite my soul,\\n  I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.\\n\\n  My tongue, every atom of my blood, form\\'d from this soil, this air,\\n  Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their\\n      parents the same,\\n  I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,\\n  Hoping to cease not till death.\\n\\n  Creeds and schools in abeyance,\\n  Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,\\n  I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,\\n  Nature without check with original energy.\\n\\n       2\\n  Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with\\n      perfumes,\\n  I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,\\n  The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.\\n\\n  The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the\\n      distillation, it is odorless,\\n  It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,\\n  I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,\\n  I am mad for it to be in contact with me.\\n\\n  The smoke of my own breath,\\n  Echoes, ripples, buzz\\'d whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine,\\n  My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing\\n      of blood and air through my lungs,\\n  The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and\\n      dark-color\\'d sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn,\\n\\n  The sound of the belch\\'d words of my voice loos\\'d to the eddies of\\n      the wind,\\n  A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,\\n  The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,\\n  The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields\\n      and hill-sides,\\n  The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising\\n      from bed and meeting the sun.\\n\\n  Have you reckon\\'d a thousand acres much? have you reckon\\'d the earth much?\\n  Have you practis\\'d so long to learn to read?\\n  Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?\\n\\n  Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of\\n      all poems,\\n  You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions\\n      of suns left,)\\n  You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through\\n      the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books,\\n  You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,\\n  You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.\\n\\n       3\\n  I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the\\n      beginning and the end,\\n  But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.\\n\\n  There was never any more inception than there is now,\\n  Nor any more youth or age than there is now,\\n  And will never be any more perfection than there is now,\\n  Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.\\n\\n  Urge and urge and urge,\\n  Always the procreant urge of the world.\\n\\n  Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and\\n      increase, always sex,\\n  Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.\\n  To elaborate is no avail, learn\\'d and unlearn\\'d feel that it is so.\\n\\n  Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well\\n      entretied, braced in the beams,\\n  Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,\\n  I and this mystery here we stand.\\n\\n  Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul.\\n\\n  Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,\\n  Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.\\n\\n  Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,\\n  Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they\\n      discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.\\n\\n  Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean,\\n  Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be\\n      less familiar than the rest.\\n\\n  I am satisfied--I see, dance, laugh, sing;\\n  As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night,\\n      and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread,\\n  Leaving me baskets cover\\'d with white towels swelling the house with\\n      their plenty,\\n  Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,\\n  That they turn from gazing after and down the road,\\n  And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,\\n  Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead?\\n\\n       4\\n  Trippers and askers surround me,\\n  People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and\\n      city I live in, or the nation,\\n  The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new,\\n  My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,\\n  The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,\\n  The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or loss\\n      or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations,\\n  Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news,\\n      the fitful events;\\n  These come to me days and nights and go from me again,\\n  But they are not the Me myself.\\n\\n  Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,\\n  Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,\\n  Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,\\n  Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next,\\n  Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.\\n\\n  Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with\\n      linguists and contenders,\\n  I have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.\\n\\n       5\\n  I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,\\n  And you must not be abased to the other.\\n\\n  Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,\\n  Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not\\n      even the best,\\n  Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.\\n\\n  I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,\\n  How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn\\'d over upon me,\\n  And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue\\n      to my bare-stript heart,\\n  And reach\\'d till you felt my beard, and reach\\'d till you held my feet.\\n\\n  Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass\\n      all the argument of the earth,\\n  And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,\\n  And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,\\n  And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women\\n      my sisters and lovers,\\n  And that a kelson of the creation is love,\\n  And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,\\n  And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,\\n  And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap\\'d stones, elder, mullein and\\n      poke-weed.\\n\\n       6\\n  A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands;\\n  How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he.\\n\\n  I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green\\n      stuff woven.\\n\\n  Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,\\n  A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,\\n  Bearing the owner\\'s name someway in the corners, that we may see\\n      and remark, and say Whose?\\n\\n  Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.\\n\\n  Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,\\n  And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,\\n  Growing among black folks as among white,\\n  Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I\\n      receive them the same.\\n\\n  And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.\\n\\n  Tenderly will I use you curling grass,\\n  It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,\\n  It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,\\n  It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out\\n      of their mothers\\' laps,\\n  And here you are the mothers\\' laps.\\n\\n  This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,\\n  Darker than the colorless beards of old men,\\n  Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.\\n\\n  O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,\\n  And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.\\n\\n  I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,\\n  And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken\\n      soon out of their laps.\\n\\n  What do you think has become of the young and old men?\\n  And what do you think has become of the women and children?\\n\\n  They are alive and well somewhere,\\n  The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,\\n  And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the\\n      end to arrest it,\\n  And ceas\\'d the moment life appear\\'d.\\n\\n  All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,\\n  And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.\\n\\n       7\\n  Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?\\n  I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.\\n\\n  I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash\\'d babe, and\\n      am not contain\\'d between my hat and boots,\\n  And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good,\\n  The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.\\n\\n  I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,\\n  I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and\\n      fathomless as myself,\\n  (They do not know how immortal, but I know.)\\n\\n  Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female,\\n  For me those that have been boys and that love women,\\n  For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted,\\n  For me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the\\n      mothers of mothers,\\n  For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,\\n  For me children and the begetters of children.\\n\\n  Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,\\n  I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,\\n  And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.\\n\\n       8\\n  The little one sleeps in its cradle,\\n  I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies\\n      with my hand.\\n\\n  The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill,\\n  I peeringly view them from the top.\\n\\n  The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,\\n  I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the pistol\\n      has fallen.\\n\\n  The blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of\\n      the promenaders,\\n  The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the\\n      clank of the shod horses on the granite floor,\\n  The snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,\\n  The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous\\'d mobs,\\n  The flap of the curtain\\'d litter, a sick man inside borne to the hospital,\\n  The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,\\n  The excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly working his\\n      passage to the centre of the crowd,\\n  The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,\\n  What groans of over-fed or half-starv\\'d who fall sunstruck or in fits,\\n  What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and\\n      give birth to babes,\\n  What living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls\\n      restrain\\'d by decorum,\\n  Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances,\\n      rejections with convex lips,\\n  I mind them or the show or resonance of them--I come and I depart.\\n\\n       9\\n  The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,\\n  The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon,\\n  The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,\\n  The armfuls are pack\\'d to the sagging mow.\\n\\n  I am there, I help, I came stretch\\'d atop of the load,\\n  I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,\\n  I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy,\\n  And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.\\n\\n       10\\n  Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,\\n  Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,\\n  In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,\\n  Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill\\'d game,\\n  Falling asleep on the gather\\'d leaves with my dog and gun by my side.\\n\\n  The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle and scud,\\n  My eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck.\\n\\n  The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,\\n  I tuck\\'d my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;\\n  You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.\\n\\n  I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west,\\n      the bride was a red girl,\\n  Her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking,\\n      they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets\\n      hanging from their shoulders,\\n  On a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant\\n      beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand,\\n  She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks\\n      descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach\\'d to her feet.\\n\\n  The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,\\n  I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,\\n  Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,\\n  And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,\\n  And brought water and fill\\'d a tub for his sweated body and bruis\\'d feet,\\n  And gave him a room that enter\\'d from my own, and gave him some\\n      coarse clean clothes,\\n  And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,\\n  And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;\\n  He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass\\'d north,\\n  I had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean\\'d in the corner.\\n\\n       11\\n  Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,\\n  Twenty-eight young men and all so friendly;\\n  Twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.\\n\\n  She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,\\n  She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window.\\n\\n  Which of the young men does she like the best?\\n  Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.\\n\\n  Where are you off to, lady? for I see you,\\n  You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.\\n\\n  Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,\\n  The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.\\n\\n  The beards of the young men glisten\\'d with wet, it ran from their long hair,\\n  Little streams pass\\'d all over their bodies.\\n\\n  An unseen hand also pass\\'d over their bodies,\\n  It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.\\n\\n  The young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to the\\n      sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,\\n  They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch,\\n  They do not think whom they souse with spray.\\n\\n       12\\n  The butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his knife\\n      at the stall in the market,\\n  I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.\\n\\n  Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,\\n  Each has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great heat in\\n      the fire.\\n\\n  From the cinder-strew\\'d threshold I follow their movements,\\n  The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms,\\n  Overhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,\\n  They do not hasten, each man hits in his place.\\n\\n       13\\n  The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags\\n      underneath on its tied-over chain,\\n  The negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady and\\n      tall he stands pois\\'d on one leg on the string-piece,\\n  His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over\\n      his hip-band,\\n  His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat\\n      away from his forehead,\\n  The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the black of\\n      his polish\\'d and perfect limbs.\\n\\n  I behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not stop there,\\n  I go with the team also.\\n\\n  In me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well as\\n      forward sluing,\\n  To niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object missing,\\n  Absorbing all to myself and for this song.\\n\\n  Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what\\n      is that you express in your eyes?\\n  It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.\\n\\n  My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and\\n      day-long ramble,\\n  They rise together, they slowly circle around.\\n\\n  I believe in those wing\\'d purposes,\\n  And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,\\n  And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,\\n  And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else,\\n  And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me,\\n  And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.\\n\\n       14\\n  The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,\\n  Ya-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,\\n  The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,\\n  Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.\\n\\n  The sharp-hoof\\'d moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the\\n      chickadee, the prairie-dog,\\n  The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,\\n  The brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread wings,\\n  I see in them and myself the same old law.\\n\\n  The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections,\\n  They scorn the best I can do to relate them.\\n\\n  I am enamour\\'d of growing out-doors,\\n  Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,\\n  Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and\\n      mauls, and the drivers of horses,\\n  I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.\\n\\n  What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,\\n  Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,\\n  Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me,\\n  Not asking the sky to come down to my good will,\\n  Scattering it freely forever.\\n\\n       15\\n  The pure contralto sings in the organ loft,\\n  The carpenter dresses his plank, the

Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn\\'d up to the clouds,\\n      or down a lane or along the beach,\\n  My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle;\\n  Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek\\'d bush-boy, (behind me\\n      he rides at the drape of the day,)\\n  Far from the settlements studying the print of animals\\' feet, or the\\n      moccasin print,\\n  By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,\\n  Nigh the coffin\\'d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;\\n  Voyaging to every port to dicker

its own full mother in its belly,\\n  Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,\\n  Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing,\\n  I tread day and night such roads.\\n\\n  I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,\\n  And look at quintillions ripen\\'d and look at quintillions green.\\n\\n  I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,\\n  My course runs below

fancies toward them,\\n  We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to\\n      be engaged,\\n  We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still\\n      feet and

Agonies are one of my changes of garments,\\n  I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the\\n      wounded person,\\n  My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.\\n\\n  I am the mash\\'d fireman with breast-bone broken,\\n  Tumbling walls buried me in their debris,\\n  Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,\\n  I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,\\n  They have clear\\'d the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.\\n\\n  I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,\\n  Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,\\n  White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared\\n      of their fire-caps,\\n  The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.\\n\\n  Distant and dead resuscitate,\\n  They show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself.\\n\\n  I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort\\'s bombardment,\\n  I am there again.\\n\\n  Again the long roll of the drummers,\\n  Again the attacking cannon, mortars,\\n  Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive.\\n\\n  I take part, I see and hear the whole,\\n  The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim\\'d shots,\\n  The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,\\n  Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,\\n  The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,\\n  The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.\\n\\n  Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves\\n      with his hand,\\n  He gasps through the clot Mind not me--mind--the entrenchments.\\n\\n       34\\n  Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,\\n  (I tell not the fall of Alamo,\\n  Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,\\n  The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)\\n  \\'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve\\n      young men.\\n\\n  Retreating they had form\\'d in a hollow square with their baggage for\\n      breastworks,\\n  Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies, nine times their\\n      number, was the price they took in advance,\\n  Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,\\n  They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv\\'d writing and\\n      seal, gave up their arms and march\\'d back prisoners of war.\\n\\n  They were the glory of the race of rangers,\\n  Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\\n  Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,\\n  Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\\n  Not a single one over thirty years of age.\\n\\n  The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and\\n      massacred, it was beautiful early summer,\\n  The work commenced about five o\\'clock and was over by eight.\\n\\n  None obey\\'d the command to kneel,\\n  Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,\\n  A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead\\n      lay together,\\n  The maim\\'d and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,\\n  Some half-kill\\'d attempted to crawl away,\\n  These were despatch\\'d with bayonets or batter\\'d with the blunts of muskets,\\n  A youth not seventeen years old seiz\\'d his assassin till two more\\n      came to release him,\\n  The three were all torn and cover\\'d with the boy\\'s blood.\\n\\n  At eleven o\\'clock began the burning of the bodies;\\n  That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.\\n\\n       35\\n  Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?\\n  Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?\\n  List to the yarn, as my grandmother\\'s father the sailor told it to me.\\n\\n  Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)\\n  His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer,\\n      and never was, and never will be;\\n  Along the lower\\'d eve he came horribly raking us.\\n\\n  We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch\\'d,\\n  My captain lash\\'d fast with his own hands.\\n\\n  We had receiv\\'d some eighteen pound shots under the water,\\n  On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire,\\n      killing all around and blowing up overhead.\\n\\n  Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,\\n  Ten o\\'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain,\\n      and five feet of water reported,\\n  The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold\\n      to give them a chance for themselves.\\n\\n  The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,\\n  They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.\\n\\n  Our frigate takes fire,\\n  The other asks if we demand quarter?\\n  If our colors are struck and the fighting done?\\n\\n  Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,\\n  We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part\\n      of the fighting.\\n\\n  Only three guns are in use,\\n  One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy\\'s main-mast,\\n  Two well serv\\'d with grape and canister silence his musketry and\\n      clear his decks.\\n\\n  The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially\\n      the main-top,\\n  They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.\\n\\n  Not a moment\\'s cease,\\n  The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.\\n\\n  One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.\\n\\n  Serene stands the little captain,\\n  He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,\\n  His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.\\n\\n  Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.\\n\\n       36\\n  Stretch\\'d and still lies the midnight,\\n  Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,\\n  Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the\\n      one we have conquer\\'d,\\n  The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a\\n      countenance white as a sheet,\\n  Near by the corpse of the child that serv\\'d in the cabin,\\n  The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully\\n      curl\\'d whiskers,\\n  The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,\\n  The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,\\n  Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh\\n      upon the masts and spars,\\n  Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,\\n  Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,\\n  A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,\\n  Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by\\n      the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,\\n  The hiss of the surgeon\\'s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,\\n  Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long,\\n      dull, tapering groan,\\n  These so, these irretrievable.\\n\\n       37\\n  You laggards there on guard! look to your arms!\\n  In at the conquer\\'d doors they crowd! I am possess\\'d!\\n  Embody all presences outlaw\\'d or suffering,\\n  See myself in prison shaped like another man,\\n  And feel the dull unintermitted pain.\\n\\n  For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch,\\n  It is I let out in the morning and barr\\'d at night.\\n\\n  Not a mutineer walks handcuff\\'d to jail but I am handcuff\\'d to him\\n      and walk by his side,\\n  (I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat\\n      on my twitching lips.)\\n\\n  Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am tried\\n      and sentenced.\\n\\n  Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp,\\n  My face is ash-color\\'d, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat.\\n\\n  Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them,\\n  I project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.\\n\\n       38\\n  Enough! enough! enough!\\n  Somehow I have been stunn\\'d. Stand back!\\n  Give me a little time beyond my cuff\\'d head, slumbers, dreams, gaping,\\n  I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.\\n\\n  That I could forget the mockers and insults!\\n  That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the\\n      bludgeons and hammers!\\n  That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and\\n      bloody crowning.\\n\\n  I remember now,\\n  I resume the overstaid fraction,\\n  The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves,\\n  Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.\\n\\n  I troop forth replenish\\'d with supreme power, one of an average\\n      unending procession,\\n  Inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,\\n  Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,\\n  The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years.\\n\\n  Eleves, I salute you! come forward!\\n  Continue your annotations, continue your questionings.\\n\\n       39\\n  The friendly and flowing savage, who is he?\\n  Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?\\n\\n  Is he some Southwesterner rais\\'d out-doors? is he Kanadian?\\n  Is he from the Mississippi country?

chops till I blow grit within you,\\n  Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets,\\n  I am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to spare,\\n  And any thing I have I

not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you,\\n  I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,\\n  And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so.\\n\\n       41\\n  I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,\\n  And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.\\n\\n  I heard what was said of the universe,\\n  Heard it and heard

name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,\\n  Lighting on every moment of my life,\\n  Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,\\n  Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine.\\n\\n  Old age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying days!\\n\\n  Every condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what grows\\n      after and out of itself,\\n  And the dark hush promulges as much as any.\\n\\n  I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,\\n  And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of\\n      the farther systems.\\n\\n  Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,\\n  Outward and outward and forever outward.\\n\\n  My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,\\n  He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,\\n  And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them.\\n\\n  There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,\\n  If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces,\\n      were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would\\n      not avail the long run,\\n  We should surely bring up again where we now stand,\\n  And surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.\\n\\n  A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do\\n      not hazard the span or make it impatient,\\n  They are but parts, any thing is but a part.\\n\\n  See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,\\n  Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that.\\n\\n  My rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,\\n  The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms,\\n  The great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be there.\\n\\n       46\\n  I know I have the best of time and space, and was never measured and\\n      never will be measured.\\n\\n  I tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)\\n  My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut from the woods,\\n  No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,\\n  I have no chair, no church, no philosophy,\\n  I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,\\n  But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,\\n  My left hand hooking you round the waist,\\n  My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road.\\n\\n  Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,\\n  You must travel it for yourself.\\n\\n  It is not far, it is within reach,\\n  Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know,\\n  Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.\\n\\n  Shoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us hasten forth,\\n  Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.\\n\\n  If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand\\n      on my hip,\\n  And in due time you shall repay the same service to me,\\n  For after we start we never lie by again.\\n\\n  This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look\\'d at the crowded heaven,\\n  And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those orbs,\\n      and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them, shall we\\n      be fill\\'d and satisfied then?\\n  And my spirit said No, we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond.\\n\\n  You are also asking me questions and I hear you,\\n  I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.\\n\\n  Sit a while dear son,\\n  Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,\\n  But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes, I kiss you\\n      with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your egress hence.\\n\\n  Long enough have you dream\\'d contemptible dreams,\\n  Now I wash the gum from your eyes,\\n  You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every\\n      moment of your life.\\n\\n  Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,\\n  Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,\\n  To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me, shout,\\n      and laughingly dash with your hair.\\n\\n       47\\n  I am the teacher of athletes,\\n  He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own,\\n  He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher.\\n\\n  The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived power,\\n      but in his own right,\\n  Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,\\n  Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,\\n  Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts,\\n  First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull\\'s eye, to sail a\\n      skiff, to sing a song or play on the banjo,\\n  Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small-pox over\\n      all latherers,\\n  And those well-tann\\'d to those that keep out of the sun.\\n\\n  I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?\\n  I follow you whoever you are from the present hour,\\n  My words itch at your ears till you understand them.\\n\\n  I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while\\n      I wait for a boat,\\n  (It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of you,\\n  Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen\\'d.)\\n\\n  I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house,\\n  And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or her\\n      who privately stays with me in the open air.\\n\\n  If you would understand me go to the heights or water-shore,\\n  The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of waves key,\\n  The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.\\n\\n  No shutter\\'d room or school can commune with me,\\n  But roughs and little children better than they.\\n\\n  The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,\\n  The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with\\n      him all day,\\n  The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice,\\n  In vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and seamen\\n      and love them.\\n\\n  The soldier camp\\'d or upon the march is mine,\\n  On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do not fail them,\\n  On that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know me seek me.\\n  My face rubs to the hunter\\'s face when he lies down alone in his blanket,\\n  The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,\\n  The young mother and old mother comprehend me,\\n  The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are,\\n  They and all would resume what I have told them.\\n\\n       48\\n  I have said that the soul is not more than the body,\\n  And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,\\n  And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one\\'s self is,\\n  And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own\\n      funeral drest in his shroud,\\n  And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth,\\n  And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the\\n      learning of all times,\\n  And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it\\n      may become a hero,\\n  And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel\\'d universe,\\n  And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed\\n      before a million universes.\\n\\n  And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,\\n  For I who am curious about each am not curious about God,\\n  (No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and\\n      about death.)\\n\\n  I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least,\\n  Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.\\n\\n  Why should I wish to see God better than this day?\\n  I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then,\\n  In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass,\\n  I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is sign\\'d\\n      by God\\'s name,\\n  And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe\\'er I go,\\n  Others will punctually come for ever and ever.\\n\\n       49\\n  And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to\\n      try to alarm me.\\n\\n  To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,\\n  I see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting,\\n  I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,\\n  And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.\\n\\n  And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that does not\\n      offend me,\\n  I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,\\n  I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish\\'d breasts of melons.\\n\\n  And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths,\\n  (No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)\\n\\n  I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,\\n  O suns--O grass of graves--O perpetual transfers and promotions,\\n  If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?\\n\\n  Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,\\n  Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight,\\n  Toss, sparkles of day and dusk--toss on the black stems that decay\\n      in the muck,\\n  Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.\\n\\n  I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,\\n  I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected,\\n  And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small.\\n\\n       50\\n  There is that in me--I do not know what it is--but I know it is in me.\\n\\n  Wrench\\'d and sweaty--calm and cool then my body becomes,\\n  I sleep--I sleep long.\\n\\n  I do not know it--it is without name--it is a word unsaid,\\n  It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.\\n\\n  Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,\\n  To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.\\n\\n  Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers and sisters.\\n\\n  Do you see O my brothers and sisters?\\n  It is not chaos or death--it is form, union, plan--it is eternal\\n      life--it is Happiness.\\n\\n       51\\n  The past and present wilt--I have fill\\'d them, emptied them.\\n  And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.\\n\\n  Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?\\n  Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,\\n  (Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.)\\n\\n  Do I contradict myself?\\n  Very well then I contradict myself,\\n  (I am large, I contain multitudes.)\\n\\n  I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.\\n\\n  Who has done his day\\'s work? who will soonest be through with his supper?\\n  Who wishes to walk with me?\\n\\n  Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?\\n\\n       52\\n  The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab\\n      and my loitering.\\n\\n  I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,\\n  I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.\\n\\n  The last scud of day holds back for me,\\n  It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow\\'d wilds,\\n  It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.\\n\\n  I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,\\n  I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.\\n\\n  I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,\\n  If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.\\n\\n  You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,\\n  But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,\\n  And filter and fibre your blood.\\n\\n  Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,\\n  Missing me one place search another,\\n  I stop somewhere waiting for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK IV.

flex of his waist\\n      and knees, dress does not hide him,\\n  The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth,\\n  To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem,

clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome,\\n  They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him,\\n  They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love,\\n  He drank water only, the blood show\\'d like scarlet through the\\n      clear-brown skin of his face,\\n  He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail\\'d his boat himself, he\\n      had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had\\n      fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him,\\n  When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish,\\n      you would pick him out as

of hell, are now consumed,\\n  Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response\\n      likewise ungovernable,\\n  Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all\\n      diffused, mine too diffused,\\n  Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling\\n      and deliciously aching,\\n  Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of\\n      love, white-blow and delirious nice,\\n  Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn,\\n  Undulating into the willing and yielding day,\\n  Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh\\'d day.\\n\\n  This the nucleus--after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman,\\n  This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and

to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters.\\n\\n  As I see my soul reflected in Nature,\\n  As I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness,\\n      sanity, beauty,\\n  See the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I see.\\n\\n       6\\n  The male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place,\\n  He too is all qualities, he is action and power,\\n  The flush of the known universe is in him,\\n  Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well,\\n  The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is\\n      utmost become him well, pride is for him,\\n  The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul,\\n  Knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing

universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.)\\n\\n  Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant?\\n  Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has\\n      no right to a sight?\\n  Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and\\n      the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts,\\n  For you only, and not for him and her?\\n\\n       7\\n  A man\\'s body at auction,\\n  (For before the war I often go to the slave-mart and watch the sale,)\\n  I help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know

uncertainty after all, that we may be deluded,\\n  That may-be reliance and hope are but speculations after all,\\n  That may-be identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only,\\n  May-be the things I perceive, the animals, plants, men, hills,\\n      shining and flowing waters,\\n  The skies of day and night, colors, densities, forms, may-be these\\n      are (as doubtless they are) only apparitions, and the real\\n      something has yet to be known,\\n  (How often they dart out of themselves as if to confound me and mock me!\\n  How often I think neither I know, nor any man knows, aught of them,)\\n  May-be seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they indeed but seem)\\n      as from my present point of view, and might prove (as of course they\\n      would) nought of what they appear, or nought anyhow, from entirely\\n      changed points of view;\\n  To me these and the like of these are curiously answer\\'d by my\\n      lovers, my dear friends,\\n  When he whom I love travels with me or sits a long while holding me\\n      by the hand,\\n  When the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and reason\\n      hold not, surround us and pervade us,\\n  Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom, I am silent, I\\n      require nothing further,\\n  I cannot answer the question of appearances or that of identity\\n      beyond the grave,\\n  But I walk or sit indifferent, I am satisfied,\\n  He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Base of All Metaphysics\\n\\n  And now gentlemen,\\n  A word I give to remain in your memories and minds,\\n  As base and finale too for all metaphysics.\\n\\n  (So to the students the old professor,\\n  At the close of his crowded course.)\\n\\n  Having studied the new and antique, the Greek and Germanic systems,\\n  Kant having studied and stated, Fichte and Schelling and Hegel,\\n  Stated the lore of Plato, and Socrates greater than Plato,\\n  And greater than Socrates sought and stated, Christ divine having\\n      studied long,\\n  I see reminiscent to-day those Greek and Germanic systems,\\n  See the philosophies all, Christian churches and tenets see,\\n  Yet underneath Socrates clearly see, and underneath Christ the divine I see,\\n  The dear love of man for his comrade, the attraction of friend to friend,\\n  Of the well-married husband and wife, of children and parents,\\n  Of city for city and land for land.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRecorders Ages Hence\\n\\n  Recorders ages hence,\\n  Come, I will take you down underneath this impassive exterior, I\\n      will tell you what to say of me,\\n  Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest lover,\\n  The friend the lover\\'s portrait, of whom his friend his lover was fondest,\\n  Who was not proud of his songs, but of the measureless ocean of love\\n      within him, and freely pour\\'d it forth,\\n  Who often walk\\'d lonesome walks thinking of his dear friends, his lovers,\\n  Who pensive away from one he lov\\'d often lay sleepless and\\n      dissatisfied at night,\\n  Who knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one he lov\\'d might\\n      secretly be indifferent to him,\\n  Whose happiest days were far away through fields, in woods, on hills,\\n      he and another wandering hand in hand, they twain apart from other men,\\n  Who oft as he saunter\\'d the streets curv\\'d with his arm the shoulder\\n      of his friend, while the arm of his friend rested upon him also.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I Heard at the Close of the Day\\n\\n  When I heard at the close of the day how my name had been receiv\\'d\\n      with plaudits in the capitol, still it was not a happy night for\\n      me that follow\\'d,\\n  And else when I carous\\'d, or when my plans were accomplish\\'d, still\\n      I was not happy,\\n  But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health,\\n      refresh\\'d, singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn,\\n  When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the\\n      morning light,\\n  When I wander\\'d alone over the beach, and undressing bathed,\\n      laughing with the cool waters, and saw the sun rise,\\n  And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way\\n      coming, O then I was happy,\\n  O then each breath tasted sweeter, and all that day my food\\n      nourish\\'d me more, and the beautiful day pass\\'d well,\\n  And the next came with equal joy, and with the next at evening came\\n      my friend,\\n  And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly\\n      continually up the shores,\\n  I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me\\n      whispering to congratulate me,\\n  For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in\\n      the cool night,\\n  In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me,\\n  And his arm lay lightly around my breast--and that night I was happy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAre You the New Person Drawn Toward Me?\\n\\n  Are you the new person drawn toward me?\\n  To begin with take warning, I am surely far different from what you suppose;\\n  Do you suppose you will find in me your ideal?\\n  Do you think it so easy to have me become your lover?\\n  Do you think the friendship of me would be unalloy\\'d satisfaction?\\n  Do you think I am trusty and faithful?\\n  Do you see no further than this facade, this smooth and tolerant\\n      manner of me?\\n  Do you suppose yourself advancing on real ground toward a real heroic man?\\n  Have you no thought O dreamer that it may be all maya, illusion?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRoots and Leaves Themselves Alone\\n\\n  Roots and leaves themselves alone are these,\\n  Scents brought to men and women from the wild woods and pond-side,\\n  Breast-sorrel and pinks of love, fingers that wind around tighter\\n      than vines,\\n  Gushes from the throats of birds hid in the foliage of trees as the\\n      sun is risen,\\n  Breezes of land and love set from living shores to you on the living\\n      sea, to you O sailors!\\n  Frost-mellow\\'d berries and Third-month twigs offer\\'d fresh to young\\n      persons wandering out in the fields when the winter breaks up,\\n  Love-buds put before you and within you whoever you are,\\n  Buds to be unfolded on the old terms,\\n  If you bring the warmth of the sun to them they will open and bring\\n      form, color, perfume, to you,\\n  If you become the aliment and the wet they will become flowers,\\n      fruits, tall branches and trees.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot Heat Flames Up and Consumes\\n\\n  Not heat flames up and consumes,\\n  Not sea-waves hurry in and out,\\n  Not the air delicious and dry, the air of ripe summer, bears lightly\\n      along white down-balls of myriads of seeds,\\n  Waited, sailing gracefully, to drop where they may;\\n  Not these, O none of these more than the flames of me, consuming,\\n      burning for his love whom I love,\\n  O none more than I hurrying in and out;\\n  Does the tide hurry, seeking something, and never give up? O I the same,\\n  O nor down-balls nor perfumes, nor the high rain-emitting clouds,\\n      are borne through the open air,\\n  Any more than my soul is borne through the open air,\\n  Wafted in all directions O love, for friendship, for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrickle Drops\\n\\n  Trickle drops! my blue veins leaving!\\n  O drops of me! trickle, slow drops,\\n  Candid from me falling, drip, bleeding drops,\\n  From wounds made to free you whence you were prison\\'d,\\n  From my face, from my forehead and lips,\\n  From my breast, from within where I was conceal\\'d, press forth red\\n      drops, confession drops,\\n  Stain every page, stain every song I sing, every word I say, bloody drops,\\n  Let them know your scarlet heat, let them glisten,\\n  Saturate them with yourself all ashamed and wet,\\n  Glow upon all I have written or shall write, bleeding drops,\\n  Let it all be seen in your light, blushing drops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCity of Orgies\\n\\n  City of orgies, walks and joys,\\n  City whom that I have lived and sung in your midst will one day make\\n  Not the pageants of you, not your shifting tableaus, your\\n      spectacles, repay me,\\n  Not the interminable rows of your houses, nor the ships at the wharves,\\n  Nor the processions in the streets, nor the bright windows with\\n      goods in them,\\n  Nor to converse with learn\\'d persons, or bear my share in the soiree\\n      or feast;\\n  Not those, but as I pass O Manhattan, your frequent and swift flash\\n      of eyes offering me love,\\n  Offering response to my own--these repay me,\\n  Lovers, continual lovers, only repay me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBehold This Swarthy Face\\n\\n  Behold this swarthy face, these gray eyes,\\n  This beard, the white wool unclipt upon my neck,\\n  My brown hands and the silent manner of me without charm;\\n  Yet comes one a Manhattanese and ever at parting kisses me lightly\\n      on the lips with robust love,\\n  And I on the crossing of the street or on the ship\\'s deck give a\\n      kiss in return,\\n  We observe that salute of American comrades land and sea,\\n  We are those two natural and nonchalant persons.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI Saw in Louisiana a Live-Oak Growing\\n\\n  I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing,\\n  All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches,\\n  Without any companion it grew there uttering joyous of dark green,\\n  And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself,\\n  But I wonder\\'d how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there\\n      without its friend near, for I knew I could not,\\n  And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it and\\n      twined around it a little moss,\\n  And brought it away, and I have placed it in sight in my room,\\n  It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,\\n  (For I believe lately I think of little else than of them,)\\n  Yet it remains to me a curious token, it makes me think of manly love;\\n  For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in Louisiana\\n      solitary in a wide in a wide flat space,\\n  Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near,\\n  I know very well I could not.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo a Stranger\\n\\n  Passing stranger! you do not know how longingly I look upon you,\\n  You must be he I was seeking, or she I was seeking, (it comes to me\\n      as of a dream,)\\n  I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you,\\n  All is recall\\'d as we flit by each other, fluid, affectionate,\\n      chaste, matured,\\n  You grew up with me, were a boy with me or a girl with me,\\n  I ate with you and slept with you, your body has become not yours\\n      only nor left my body mine only,\\n  You give me the pleasure of your eyes, face, flesh, as we pass, you\\n      take of my beard, breast, hands, in return,\\n  I am not to speak to you, I am to think of you when I sit alone or\\n      wake at night alone,\\n  I am to wait, I do not doubt I am to meet you again,\\n  I am to see to it that I do not lose you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis Moment Yearning and Thoughtful\\n\\n  This moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone,\\n  It seems to me there are other men in other lands yearning and thoughtful,\\n  It seems to me I can look over and behold them in Germany, Italy,\\n      France, Spain,\\n  Or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or talking other dialects,\\n  And it seems to me if I could know those men I should become\\n      attached to them as I do to men in my own lands,\\n  O I know we should be brethren and lovers,\\n  I know I should be happy with them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI Hear It Was Charged Against Me\\n\\n  I hear it was charged against me that I sought to destroy institutions,\\n  But really I am neither for nor against institutions,\\n  (What indeed have I in common with them? or what with the\\n      destruction of them?)\\n  Only I will establish in the Mannahatta and in every city of these\\n      States inland and seaboard,\\n  And in the fields and woods, and above every keel little or large\\n      that dents the water,\\n  Without edifices or rules or trustees or any argument,\\n  The institution of the dear love of comrades.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Prairie-Grass Dividing\\n\\n  The prairie-grass dividing, its special odor breathing,\\n  I demand of it the spiritual corresponding,\\n  Demand the most copious and close companionship of men,\\n  Demand the blades to rise of words, acts, beings,\\n  Those of the open atmosphere, coarse, sunlit, fresh, nutritious,\\n  Those that go their own gait, erect, stepping with freedom and\\n      command, leading not following,\\n  Those with a never-quell\\'d audacity, those with sweet and lusty\\n      flesh clear of taint,\\n  Those that look carelessly in the faces of Presidents and governors,\\n      as to say Who are you?\\n  Those of earth-born passion, simple, never constrain\\'d, never obedient,\\n  Those of inland America.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I Peruse the Conquer\\'d Fame\\n\\n  When I peruse the conquer\\'d fame of heroes and the victories of\\n      mighty generals, I do not envy the generals,\\n  Nor the President in his Presidency, nor the rich in his great house,\\n  But when I hear of the brotherhood of lovers, how it was with them,\\n  How together through life, through dangers, odium, unchanging, long\\n      and long,\\n  Through youth and through middle and old age, how unfaltering, how\\n      affectionate and faithful they were,\\n  Then I am pensive--I hastily walk away fill\\'d with the bitterest envy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe Two Boys Together Clinging\\n\\n  We two boys together clinging,\\n  One the other never leaving,\\n  Up and down the roads going, North and South excursions making,\\n  Power enjoying, elbows stretching, fingers clutching,\\n  Arm\\'d and fearless, eating, drinking, sleeping, loving.\\n  No law less than ourselves owning, sailing, soldiering, thieving,\\n      threatening,\\n  Misers, menials, priests alarming, air breathing, water drinking, on\\n      the turf or the sea-beach dancing,\\n  Cities wrenching, ease scorning, statutes mocking, feebleness

east a while longer, soon I travel toward you, to remain,\\n      to teach robust American love,\\n  For I know very well that I and robust love belong among you,\\n      inland, and along the Western

success nor intellect; nor book for the book-shelf,\\n  But a few carols vibrating through the air I leave,\\n  For comrades and lovers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA Glimpse\\n\\n  A glimpse through an interstice caught,\\n  Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar-room around the stove\\n      late of a winter night, and I unremark\\'d seated in a corner,\\n  Of a youth who loves me and whom I love, silently approaching and\\n      seating himself near, that he may hold me by the hand,\\n  A long while amid the noises of coming and going, of drinking and\\n      oath and smutty jest,\\n  There we two, content, happy in being together, speaking little,\\n      perhaps not a word.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA Leaf for Hand in Hand\\n\\n  A leaf for hand in hand;\\n  You natural persons old and young!\\n  You

spheric there,\\n  I now suspect that is not all;\\n  I now suspect there is something fierce in you eligible to burst forth,\\n  For an athlete is enamour\\'d of me, and I of him,\\n  But toward him there is something fierce and terrible in me eligible\\n      to burst forth,\\n  I dare not tell it in words, not even in these songs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI Dream\\'d in a Dream\\n\\n  I dream\\'d in a dream I saw a city invincible to the attacks of the\\n      whole of the rest of the earth,\\n  I dream\\'d that was the new city of Friends,\\n  Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love, it led the rest,\\n  It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city,\\n  And in all their looks and words.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Think You I Take My Pen in Hand?\\n\\n  What think you I take my pen in hand to record?\\n  The battle-ship, perfect-model\\'d, majestic, that I saw pass the\\n      offing to-day under full sail?\\n  The splendors of the past day? or the splendor of the night that\\n      envelops me?\\n  Or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around me? --no;\\n  But merely of two simple men I saw to-day on the pier in the midst\\n      of the crowd, parting the parting of dear friends,\\n  The one to remain hung on the other\\'s neck and passionately kiss\\'d him,\\n  While the one to depart tightly prest the one to remain in his

to the open road,\\n  Healthy, free, the world before me,\\n  The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.\\n\\n  Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune,\\n  Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing,\\n  Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,\\n  Strong and content I travel the open road.\\n\\n  The earth, that is sufficient,\\n  I do not want the constellations any nearer,\\n  I know they are very well where they are,\\n  I know they suffice for those who belong to them.\\n\\n  (Still here I carry my old delicious burdens,\\n  I carry them, men and women, I carry them with me wherever I go,\\n  I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them,\\n  I am fill\\'d with them, and I will fill them in return.)\\n\\n       2\\n  You road I enter upon and look around, I believe you are not all\\n      that is here,\\n  I believe that much unseen is also here.\\n\\n  Here the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor denial,\\n  The black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas\\'d, the\\n      illiterate person, are not denied;\\n  The birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar\\'s tramp, the\\n      drunkard\\'s stagger, the laughing party of mechanics,\\n  The escaped youth, the rich person\\'s carriage, the fop, the eloping couple,\\n  The early market-man, the hearse, the moving of furniture into the\\n      town, the return back from the town,\\n  They pass, I also pass, any thing passes, none can be interdicted,\\n  None but are accepted, none but shall be dear to me.\\n\\n       3\\n  You air that serves me with breath to speak!\\n  You objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them shape!\\n  You light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers!\\n  You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides!\\n  I believe you are latent with unseen existences, you are so dear to me.\\n\\n  You flagg\\'d walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges!\\n  You ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timber-lined\\n      side! you distant ships!\\n  You rows of houses! you window-pierc\\'d facades! you roofs!\\n  You porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards!\\n  You windows whose transparent shells might expose so much!\\n  You doors and ascending steps! you arches!\\n  You gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings!\\n  From all that has touch\\'d you I believe you have imparted to\\n      yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me,\\n  From the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces,\\n      and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me.\\n\\n       4\\n  The earth expanding right hand and left hand,\\n  The picture alive, every part in its best light,\\n  The music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping where it is\\n      not wanted,\\n  The cheerful voice of the public road, the gay fresh sentiment of the road.\\n\\n  O highway I travel, do you say to me Do not leave me?\\n  Do you say Venture not--if you leave me you are lost?\\n  Do you say I am already prepared, I am well-beaten and undenied,\\n      adhere to me?\\n\\n  O public road, I say back I am not afraid to leave you, yet I love you,\\n  You express me better than I can express myself,\\n  You shall be more to me than my poem.\\n\\n  I think heroic deeds were all conceiv\\'d in the open air, and all\\n      free poems also,\\n  I think I could stop here myself and do miracles,\\n  I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like, and whoever\\n      beholds me shall like me,\\n  I think whoever I see must be happy.\\n\\n       5\\n  From this hour I ordain myself loos\\'d of limits and imaginary lines,\\n  Going where I list, my own master total and absolute,\\n  Listening to others, considering well what they say,\\n  Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,\\n  Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that\\n      would hold me.\\n\\n  I inhale great draughts of space,\\n  The east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are mine.\\n\\n  I am larger, better than I thought,\\n  I did not know I held so much goodness.\\n\\n  All seems beautiful to me,\\n  can repeat over to men and women You have done such good to me\\n      I would do the same to you,\\n  I will recruit for myself and you as I go,\\n  I will scatter myself among men and women as I go,\\n  I will toss a new gladness and roughness among them,\\n  Whoever denies me it shall not trouble me,\\n  Whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me.\\n\\n       6\\n  Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me,\\n  Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear\\'d it would not\\n      astonish me.\\n\\n  Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons,\\n  It is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth.\\n\\n  Here a great personal deed has room,\\n  (Such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men,\\n  Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all\\n      authority and all argument against it.)\\n\\n  Here is the test of wisdom,\\n  Wisdom is not finally tested in schools,\\n  Wisdom cannot be pass\\'d from one having it to another not having it,\\n  Wisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof,\\n  Applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content,\\n  Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the\\n      excellence of things;\\n  Something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes\\n      it out of the soul.\\n\\n  Now I re-examine philosophies and religions,\\n  They may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all under the\\n      spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents.\\n\\n  Here is realization,\\n  Here is a man tallied--he realizes here what he has in him,\\n  The past, the future, majesty, love--if they are vacant of you, you\\n      are vacant of them.\\n\\n  Only the kernel of every object nourishes;\\n  Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me?\\n  Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me?\\n\\n  Here is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion\\'d, it is apropos;\\n  Do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers?\\n  Do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls?\\n\\n       7\\n  Here is the efflux of the soul,\\n  The efflux of the soul comes from within through embower\\'d gates,\\n      ever provoking questions,\\n  These yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness why are they?\\n  Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight\\n      expands my blood?\\n  Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?\\n  Why are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious\\n      thoughts descend upon me?\\n  (I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always\\n      drop fruit as I pass;)\\n  What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?\\n  What with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side?\\n  What with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I walk by\\n      and pause?\\n  What gives me to be free to a woman\\'s and man\\'s good-will? what\\n      gives them to be free to mine?\\n\\n       8\\n  The efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness,\\n  I think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times,\\n  Now it flows unto us, we are rightly charged.\\n\\n  Here rises the fluid and attaching character,\\n  The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of\\n      man and woman,\\n  (The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day\\n      out of the roots of themselves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet\\n      continually out of itself.)\\n\\n  Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the\\n      love of young and old,\\n  From it falls distill\\'d the charm that mocks beauty and attainments,\\n  Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact.\\n\\n       9\\n  Allons! whoever you are come travel with me!\\n  Traveling with me you find what never tires.\\n\\n  The earth never tires,\\n  The earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first, Nature is rude\\n      and incomprehensible at first,\\n  Be not discouraged, keep on, there are divine things well envelop\\'d,\\n  I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell.\\n\\n  Allons! we must not stop here,\\n  However sweet these laid-up stores, however convenient this dwelling\\n      we cannot remain here,\\n  However shelter\\'d this port and however calm these waters we must\\n      not anchor here,\\n  However welcome the hospitality that surrounds us we are permitted\\n      to receive it but a little while.\\n\\n       10\\n  Allons! the inducements shall be greater,\\n  We will sail pathless and wild seas,\\n  We will go where winds blow, waves dash, and the Yankee clipper\\n      speeds by under full sail.\\n\\n  Allons! with power, liberty, the earth, the elements,\\n  Health, defiance, gayety, self-esteem, curiosity;\\n  Allons! from all formules!\\n  From your formules, O bat-eyed and materialistic priests.\\n\\n  The stale cadaver blocks up the passage--the burial waits no longer.\\n\\n  Allons! yet take warning!\\n  He traveling with me needs the best blood, thews, endurance,\\n  None may come to the trial till he or she bring courage and health,\\n  Come not here if you have already spent the best of yourself,\\n  Only those may come who come in sweet and determin\\'d bodies,\\n  No diseas\\'d person, no rum-drinker or venereal taint is permitted here.\\n\\n  (I and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes,\\n  We convince by our presence.)\\n\\n       11\\n  Listen! I will be honest with you,\\n  I do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer rough new prizes,\\n  These are the days that must happen to you:\\n  You shall not heap up what is call\\'d riches,\\n  You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve,\\n  You but arrive at the city to which you were destin\\'d, you hardly\\n      settle yourself to satisfaction before you are call\\'d by an\\n      irresistible call to depart,\\n  You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those\\n      who remain behind you,\\n  What beckonings of love you receive you shall only answer with\\n      passionate kisses of parting,\\n  You shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reach\\'d hands\\n      toward you.\\n\\n       12\\n  Allons! after the great Companions, and to belong to them!\\n  They too are on the road--they are the swift and majestic men--they\\n      are the greatest women,\\n  Enjoyers of calms of seas and storms of seas,\\n  Sailors of many a ship, walkers of many a mile of land,\\n  Habitues of many distant countries, habitues of far-distant dwellings,\\n  Trusters of men and women, observers of cities, solitary toilers,\\n  Pausers and contemplators of tufts, blossoms, shells of the shore,\\n  Dancers at wedding-dances, kissers of brides, tender helpers of\\n      children, bearers of children,\\n  Soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves, lowerers-down of coffins,\\n  Journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the years, the curious\\n      years each emerging from that which preceded it,\\n  Journeyers as with companions, namely their own diverse phases,\\n  Forth-steppers from the latent unrealized baby-days,\\n  Journeyers gayly with their own youth, journeyers with their bearded\\n      and well-grain\\'d manhood,\\n  Journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsurpass\\'d, content,\\n  Journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood or womanhood,\\n  Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of the universe,\\n  Old age, flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom of death.\\n\\n       13\\n  Allons! to that which is endless as it was beginningless,\\n  To undergo much, tramps of days, rests of nights,\\n  To merge all in the travel they tend to, and the days and nights\\n      they tend to,\\n  Again to merge them in the start of superior journeys,\\n  To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass it,\\n  To conceive no time, however distant, but what you may reach it and pass it,\\n  To look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for you,\\n      however long but it stretches and waits for you,\\n  To see no being, not God\\'s or any, but you also go thither,\\n  To see no possession but you may possess it, enjoying all without\\n      labor or purchase, abstracting the feast yet not abstracting one\\n      particle of it,\\n  To take the best of the farmer\\'s farm and the rich man\\'s elegant\\n      villa, and the chaste blessings of the well-married couple, and\\n      the fruits of orchards and flowers of gardens,\\n  To take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass through,\\n  To carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you go,\\n  To gather the minds of men out of their brains as you encounter\\n      them, to gather the love out of their hearts,\\n  To take your lovers on the road with you, for all that you leave\\n      them behind you,\\n  To know the universe itself as a road, as many roads, as roads for\\n      traveling souls.\\n\\n  All parts away for the progress of souls,\\n  All religion, all solid things, arts, governments--all that was or is\\n      apparent upon this globe or any globe, falls into niches and corners\\n      before the procession of souls along the grand roads of the universe.\\n\\n  Of the progress of the souls of men and women along the grand roads of\\n      the universe, all other progress is the needed emblem and sustenance.\\n\\n  Forever alive, forever forward,\\n  Stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbulent, feeble,\\n      dissatisfied,\\n  Desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by men, rejected by men,\\n  They go! they go!

smallest sights and hearings, on\\n      the walk in the street and the passage over the river,\\n  The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away,\\n  The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them,\\n  The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others.\\n\\n  Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore,\\n  Others will watch the run of the flood-tide,\\n  Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the\\n      heights of Brooklyn to the south and east,\\n  Others will see the islands large and small;\\n  Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half\\n      an hour high,\\n  A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others\\n      will see them,\\n  Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the\\n      falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide.\\n\\n       3\\n  It avails not, time nor place--distance avails not,\\n  I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many\\n      generations hence,\\n  Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt,\\n  Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd,\\n  Just as you are refresh\\'d by the gladness of the river and the\\n      bright flow, I was refresh\\'d,\\n  Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift\\n      current, I stood yet was hurried,\\n  Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the\\n      thick-stemm\\'d pipes of steamboats, I look\\'d.\\n\\n  I too many and many a time cross\\'d the river of old,\\n  Watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them high in the air\\n      floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,\\n  Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left\\n      the rest in strong shadow,\\n  Saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south,\\n  Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,\\n  Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,\\n  Look\\'d at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my\\n      head in the sunlit water,\\n  Look\\'d on the haze on the hills southward and south-westward,\\n  Look\\'d on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,\\n  Look\\'d toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving,\\n  Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,\\n  Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor,\\n  The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars,\\n  The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender\\n      serpentine pennants,\\n  The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilothouses,\\n  The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels,\\n  The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset,\\n  The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the\\n      frolic-some crests and glistening,\\n  The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the\\n      granite storehouses by the docks,\\n  On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank\\'d on\\n      each side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated lighter,\\n  On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning\\n      high and glaringly into the night,\\n  Casting their flicker of black

well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river,\\n  The men and women I saw were all near to me,\\n  Others the same--others who look back on me because I look\\'d forward\\n      to them,\\n  (The time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.)\\n\\n       5\\n  What is it then between us?\\n  What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?\\n\\n  Whatever it is, it avails not--distance avails not, and place avails not,\\n  I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine,\\n  I too walk\\'d the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in the\\n      waters around it,\\n  I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,\\n  In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me,\\n  In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me,\\n  I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution,\\n  I too had receiv\\'d identity by my body,\\n  That I was I knew was of my body, and what I should be I knew I\\n      should be of my body.\\n\\n       6\\n  It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,\\n  The dark threw its patches down upon me also,\\n  The best I had done seem\\'d to me blank and suspicious,\\n  My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?\\n  Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil,\\n  I am he who knew what it was to be evil,\\n  I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,\\n  Blabb\\'d, blush\\'d, resented, lied, stole, grudg\\'d,\\n  Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,\\n  Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant,\\n  The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me.\\n  The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting,\\n\\n  Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting,\\n  Was one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest,\\n  Was call\\'d by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as\\n      they saw me approaching or passing,\\n  Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of\\n      their flesh against me as I sat,\\n  Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet\\n      never told them a word,\\n  Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping,\\n  Play\\'d the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,\\n  The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like,\\n  Or as small as we like, or both great and small.\\n\\n       7\\n  Closer yet I approach you,\\n  What thought you have of me now, I had as much of you--I laid in my\\n      stores in advance,\\n  I consider\\'d long and seriously of you before you were born.\\n\\n  Who was to know what should come home to me?\\n  Who knows but I am enjoying this?\\n  Who knows, for all the distance, but I am as good as looking at you\\n      now, for all you cannot see me?\\n\\n       8\\n  Ah, what can ever be more stately and

and the belated lighter?\\n  What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with voices I\\n      love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as approach?\\n  What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that\\n      looks in my face?\\n  Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you?\\n\\n  We understand then do we not?\\n  What I promis\\'d without mentioning it, have you not accepted?\\n  What the study could not teach--what the preaching could not\\n      accomplish is accomplish\\'d, is it not?\\n\\n       9\\n  Flow on, river! flow

brain! throw out questions and answers!\\n  Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!\\n  Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public assembly!\\n  Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my\\n      nighest name!\\n  Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress!\\n  Play the old role, the role that is great or small according as one\\n      makes it!\\n  Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be\\n      looking upon you;\\n  Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet\\n      haste with the hasting current;\\n  Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air;\\n  Receive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till all\\n      downcast eyes have time to take it from you!\\n  Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any\\n      one\\'s head, in the sunlit water!\\n  Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail\\'d\\n      schooners, sloops, lighters!\\n  Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower\\'d at sunset!\\n  Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at\\n      nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses!\\n  Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are,\\n  You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul,\\n  About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung our divinest aromas,\\n  Thrive, cities--bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and\\n      sufficient rivers,\\n  Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual,\\n  Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.\\n\\n  You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers,\\n  We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward,\\n  Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us,\\n  We use you, and do not cast you aside--we plant you permanently within us,\\n  We fathom you not--we love you--there is perfection in you also,\\n  You furnish your parts toward eternity,\\n  Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK IX\\n\\n\\nSong of the Answerer\\n\\n       1\\n  Now list to my morning\\'s romanza, I tell the signs of the Answerer,\\n  To the cities and farms I sing as they spread in the sunshine before me.\\n\\n  A young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother,\\n  How shall the young man know the whether and when of his brother?\\n  Tell him to send me the signs. And I stand before the young man\\n      face to face, and take his right hand in my left hand and his\\n      left hand in my right hand,\\n  And I answer for his brother and for men, and I answer for him that\\n      answers for all, and send these signs.\\n\\n  Him all wait for, him all yield up to, his word is decisive and final,\\n  Him they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves as amid light,\\n  Him they immerse and he immerses them.\\n\\n  Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape,\\n      people, animals,\\n  The profound earth and its attributes and the unquiet ocean, (so\\n      tell I my morning\\'s romanza,)\\n  All enjoyments and properties and money, and whatever money will buy,\\n  The best farms, others toiling and planting and he unavoidably reaps,\\n  The noblest and costliest cities, others grading and building and he\\n      domiciles there,\\n  Nothing for any one but what is for him, near and far are for him,\\n      the ships in the offing,\\n  The perpetual shows and marches on land are for him if they are for anybody.\\n\\n  He puts things in their attitudes,\\n  He puts to-day out of himself with plasticity and love,\\n  He places his own times, reminiscences, parents, brothers and\\n      sisters, associations, employment, politics, so that the rest\\n      never shame them afterward, nor assume to command them.\\n\\n  He is the Answerer,\\n  What can be answer\\'d he answers, and what cannot be answer\\'d he\\n      shows how it cannot be answer\\'d.\\n\\n  A man is a summons and challenge,\\n  (It is vain to skulk--do you hear that mocking and laughter? do you\\n      hear the ironical echoes?)\\n\\n  Books, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure, pride,\\n      beat up and down seeking to give satisfaction,\\n  He indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up and\\n      down also.\\n\\n  Whichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he may go freshly\\n      and gently and safely by day or by night,\\n  He has the pass-key of hearts, to him the response of the prying of\\n      hands on the knobs.\\n\\n  His welcome is universal, the flow of beauty is not more welcome or\\n      universal than he is,\\n  The person he favors by day or sleeps with at night is blessed.\\n\\n  Every existence has its idiom, every thing has an idiom and tongue,\\n  He resolves all tongues into his own and bestows it upon men, and\\n      any man translates, and any man translates himself also,\\n  One part does not counteract another part, he is the joiner, he sees\\n      how they join.\\n\\n  He says indifferently and alike How are you friend? to the President\\n      at his levee,\\n  And he says Good-day my brother, to Cudge that hoes in the sugar-field,\\n  And both understand him and know that his speech is right.\\n\\n  He walks with perfect ease in the capitol,\\n  He walks among the Congress, and one Representative says to another,\\n      Here is our equal appearing and new.\\n\\n  Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic,\\n  And the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors that\\n      he has follow\\'d the sea,\\n  And the authors take him for an author, and the artists for an artist,\\n  And the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them,\\n  No matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it or has\\n      follow\\'d it,\\n  No matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers and\\n      sisters there.\\n\\n  The English believe he comes of their English stock,\\n  A Jew to the Jew he seems, a Russ to the Russ, usual and near,\\n      removed from none.\\n\\n  Whoever he looks at in the traveler\\'s coffee-house claims him,\\n  The Italian or Frenchman is sure, the German is sure, the Spaniard\\n      is sure, and the island Cuban is sure,\\n  The engineer, the deck-hand on the great lakes, or on the Mississippi\\n      or St. Lawrence or Sacramento, or Hudson or Paumanok sound, claims him.\\n\\n  The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood,\\n  The insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see\\n      themselves in the ways of him, he strangely transmutes them,\\n  They are not vile any more, they hardly know themselves they are so grown.\\n\\n       2\\n  The indications and tally of time,\\n  Perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs,\\n  Time, always without break, indicates itself in parts,\\n  What always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant company\\n      of singers, and their words,\\n  The words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or dark,\\n      but the words of the maker of poems are the general light and dark,\\n  The maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,\\n  His insight and power encircle things and the human race,\\n  He is the glory and extract thus far of things and of the human race.\\n\\n  The singers do not beget, only the Poet begets,\\n  The singers are welcom\\'d, understood, appear often enough, but rare\\n      has the day been, likewise the spot, of the birth of the maker\\n      of poems, the Answerer,\\n  (Not every century nor every five centuries has contain\\'d such a\\n      day, for all its names.)\\n\\n  The singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible\\n      names, but the name of each of them is one of the singers,\\n  The name of each is, eye-singer, ear-singer, head-singer,\\n      sweet-singer, night-singer, parlor-singer, love-singer,\\n      weird-singer, or something else.\\n\\n  All this time and at all times wait the words of true poems,\\n  The words of true poems do not merely please,\\n  The true poets are not followers of beauty but the august masters of beauty;\\n  The greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers\\n      and fathers,\\n  The words of true poems are the tuft and final applause of science.\\n\\n  Divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health,\\n      rudeness of body, withdrawnness,\\n  Gayety, sun-tan, air-sweetness, such are some of the words of poems.\\n\\n  The sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer,\\n  The builder, geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenologist, artist, all\\n      these underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer.\\n\\n  The words of the true poems give you more than poems,\\n  They give you to form for yourself poems, religions, politics, war,\\n      peace, behavior, histories, essays, daily life, and every thing else,\\n  They balance ranks, colors, races, creeds, and the sexes,\\n  They do not seek beauty, they are sought,\\n  Forever touching them or close upon them follows beauty, longing,\\n      fain, love-sick.\\n\\n  They prepare for death, yet are they not the finish, but rather the outset,\\n  They bring none to his or her terminus or to be content and full,\\n  Whom they take they take into space to behold the birth of stars, to\\n      learn one of the meanings,\\n  To launch off with absolute faith, to sweep through the ceaseless\\n      rings and never be quiet again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK X\\n\\n\\nOur Old

offices, eternal uses of the earth.\\n\\n  O to attract by more than attraction!\\n  How it is I know not--yet behold! the something which obeys none\\n      of the rest,\\n  It is offensive, never defensive--yet how magnetic it draws.\\n\\n  O to struggle against great odds, to meet enemies undaunted!\\n  To be entirely alone with them, to find how much one can stand!\\n  To look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, face to face!\\n  To mount the scaffold, to advance to the muzzles of guns with\\n      perfect nonchalance!\\n  To be indeed a God!\\n\\n  O to sail to sea in a ship!\\n  To leave this steady unendurable land,\\n  To leave the tiresome sameness of the streets, the sidewalks and the\\n      houses,\\n  To leave you O you solid motionless land, and entering a

forest dense.\\n\\n  Farewell my brethren,\\n  Farewell O earth and sky, farewell ye neighboring waters,\\n  My time has ended, my term has come.\\n\\n  Along the northern coast,\\n  Just back from the rock-bound shore and the caves,\\n  In the saline air from the sea in the Mendocino country,\\n  With the surge for base and accompaniment low and hoarse,\\n  With crackling blows of axes sounding musically driven by strong arms,\\n  Riven deep by the sharp tongues of the axes, there in the redwood\\n      forest dense,\\n  I heard the might tree its death-chant chanting.\\n\\n  The choppers heard not, the camp shanties echoed not,\\n  The quick-ear\\'d teamsters and chain and jack-screw men heard not,\\n  As the wood-spirits came from their haunts of a thousand years to\\n      join the refrain,\\n  But in my soul I plainly heard.\\n\\n  Murmuring out of its myriad leaves,\\n  Down from its lofty top rising two hundred feet high,\\n  Out of its stalwart trunk and limbs, out of its foot-thick bark,\\n  That chant of the seasons and time, chant not of the past only but\\n      the future.\\n\\n  You untold life of me,\\n  And all you venerable and innocent joys,\\n  Perennial hardy life of me with joys \\'mid rain and many a summer sun,\\n  And the white snows and night and the wild winds;\\n  O the great patient rugged joys, my soul\\'s strong joys unreck\\'d by man,\\n  (For know I bear the soul befitting me, I too have consciousness, identity,\\n  And all the rocks and mountains have, and all the earth,)\\n  Joys of the life befitting me and brothers mine,\\n  Our

absorb\\'d, assimilated.\\n\\n  Then to a loftier strain,\\n  Still prouder, more ecstatic rose the chant,\\n  As if the heirs, the deities of the West,\\n  Joining with master-tongue bore part.\\n\\n

will be even with you and you shall be even with me.\\n\\n  If you stand at work in a shop I stand as nigh as the nighest in the\\n      same shop,\\n  If you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest

have you thought of yourself?\\n  Is it you then that thought yourself less?\\n  Is it you that thought the President greater than you?\\n  Or the rich better off than you? or the educated wiser than you?\\n\\n  (Because you are greasy or pimpled, or were once drunk, or a thief,\\n  Or that you are diseas\\'d, or rheumatic, or a prostitute,\\n  Or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no

XVI\\n\\n\\nA Song of the Rolling Earth\\n\\n       1\\n  A song of the rolling earth, and of words according,\\n  Were you thinking that those were the words, those upright lines?\\n      those curves, angles, dots?\\n  No, those are not the words, the substantial words are in the ground\\n      and sea,\\n  They are in the air, they are in you.\\n\\n  Were you thinking that those were the words, those delicious sounds\\n      out of your friends\\' mouths?\\n  No, the real words are more delicious than they.\\n\\n  Human bodies are words, myriads of words,\\n  (In the best poems re-appears the body, man\\'s or woman\\'s,\\n      well-shaped, natural, gay,\\n  Every part able, active, receptive, without shame or the need of shame.)\\n\\n  Air, soil, water, fire--those are words,\\n  I myself am a word with them--my qualities interpenetrate with\\n      theirs--my name is nothing to them,\\n  Though it were told in the three thousand languages, what would\\n      air, soil, water, fire, know of my name?\\n\\n  A healthy presence, a friendly or commanding gesture, are words,\\n      sayings, meanings,\\n  The charms that go with the mere looks of some men and women,\\n      are sayings and meanings also.\\n\\n  The workmanship of souls is by those inaudible words of the earth,\\n  The masters know the earth\\'s words and use them more than audible words.\\n\\n  Amelioration is one of the earth\\'s words,\\n  The earth neither lags nor hastens,\\n  It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself from the jump,\\n  It is not half beautiful only, defects and excrescences show just as\\n      much as perfections show.\\n\\n  The earth does not withhold, it is generous enough,\\n  The truths of the earth continually wait, they are not so conceal\\'d either,\\n  They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print,\\n  They are imbued through all things conveying themselves willingly,\\n  Conveying a sentiment and invitation, I utter and utter,\\n  I speak not, yet if you hear me not of what avail am I to you?\\n  To bear, to better, lacking these of what avail am I?\\n\\n  (Accouche! accouchez!\\n  Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there?\\n  Will you squat and stifle there?)\\n\\n  The earth does not argue,\\n  Is not pathetic, has no arrangements,\\n  Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,\\n  Makes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures,\\n  Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out,\\n  Of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts none out.\\n\\n  The earth does not exhibit itself nor refuse to exhibit itself,\\n      possesses still underneath,\\n  Underneath the ostensible sounds, the august chorus of heroes, the\\n      wail of slaves,\\n  Persuasions of lovers, curses, gasps of the dying, laughter of young\\n      people, accents of bargainers,\\n  Underneath these possessing words that never fall.\\n\\n  To her children the words of the eloquent dumb great mother never fail,\\n  The true words do not fail, for motion does not fail and reflection\\n      does not fall,\\n  Also the day and night do not fall, and the voyage we pursue does not fall.\\n\\n  Of the interminable sisters,\\n  Of the ceaseless cotillons of sisters,\\n  Of the centripetal and centrifugal sisters, the elder and younger sisters,\\n  The beautiful sister we know dances on with the rest.\\n\\n  With her ample back towards every beholder,\\n  With the fascinations of youth and the equal fascinations of age,\\n  Sits she whom I too love like the rest, sits undisturb\\'d,\\n  Holding up in her hand what has the character of a mirror, while her\\n      eyes glance back from it,\\n  Glance as she sits, inviting none, denying none,\\n  Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before her own face.\\n\\n  Seen at hand or seen at a distance,\\n  Duly the twenty-four appear in public every day,\\n  Duly approach and pass with their companions or a companion,\\n  Looking from no countenances of their own, but from the countenances\\n      of those who are with them,\\n  From the countenances of children or women or the manly countenance,\\n  From the open countenances of animals or from inanimate things,\\n  From the landscape or waters or from the exquisite apparition of the sky,\\n  From our countenances, mine and yours, faithfully returning them,\\n  Every day in public appearing without fall, but never twice with the\\n      same companions.\\n\\n  Embracing man, embracing all, proceed the three hundred and\\n      sixty-five resistlessly round the sun;\\n  Embracing all, soothing, supporting, follow close three hundred and\\n      sixty-five offsets of the first, sure and necessary as they.\\n\\n  Tumbling on steadily, nothing dreading,\\n  Sunshine, storm, cold, heat, forever withstanding, passing, carrying,\\n  The soul\\'s realization and determination still inheriting,\\n  The fluid vacuum around and ahead still entering and dividing,\\n  No balk retarding, no anchor anchoring, on no rock striking,\\n  Swift, glad, content, unbereav\\'d, nothing losing,\\n  Of all able and ready at any time to give strict account,\\n  The divine ship sails the divine sea.\\n\\n       2\\n  Whoever you are! motion and reflection are especially for you,\\n  The divine ship sails the divine sea for you.\\n\\n  Whoever you are! you are he or she for whom the earth is solid and liquid,\\n  You are he or she for whom the sun and moon hang in the sky,\\n  For none more than you are the present and the past,\\n  For none more than you is immortality.\\n\\n  Each man to himself and each woman to herself, is the word of the\\n      past and present, and the true word of immortality;\\n  No one can acquire for another--not one,\\n  Not one can grow for another--not one.\\n\\n  The song is to the singer, and comes back most to him,\\n  The teaching is to the teacher, and comes back most to him,\\n  The murder is to the murderer, and comes back most to him,\\n  The theft is to the thief, and comes back most to him,\\n  The love is to the lover, and comes back most to him,\\n  The gift is to the giver, and comes back most to him--it cannot fail,\\n  The oration is to the orator, the acting is to the actor and actress\\n      not to the audience,\\n  And no man understands any greatness or goodness but his own, or\\n      the indication of his own.\\n\\n       3\\n  I swear the earth shall surely be complete to him or her who shall\\n      be complete,\\n  The earth remains jagged and broken only to him or her who remains\\n      jagged and broken.\\n\\n  I swear there is no greatness or power that does not emulate those\\n      of the earth,\\n  There can be no theory of any account unless it corroborate the\\n      theory of the earth,\\n  No politics, song, religion, behavior, or what not, is of account,\\n      unless it compare with the amplitude of the earth,\\n  Unless it face the exactness, vitality, impartiality, rectitude of\\n      the earth.\\n\\n  I swear I begin to see love with sweeter spasms than that which\\n      responds love,\\n  It is that which contains itself, which never invites and never refuses.\\n\\n  I swear I begin to see little or nothing in audible words,\\n  All merges toward the presentation of the unspoken meanings of the earth,\\n  Toward him who sings the songs of the body and of the truths of the earth,\\n  Toward him who makes the dictionaries of words that print cannot touch.\\n\\n  I swear I see what is better than to tell the best,\\n  It is always to leave the best untold.\\n\\n  When I undertake to tell the best I find I cannot,\\n  My tongue is ineffectual on its pivots,\\n  My breath will not be obedient to its organs,\\n  I become a dumb man.\\n\\n  The best of the earth cannot be told anyhow, all or any is best,\\n  It is not what you anticipated, it is cheaper, easier, nearer,\\n  Things are not dismiss\\'d from the places they held before,\\n  The earth is just as positive and direct as it was before,\\n  Facts, religions, improvements, politics, trades, are as real as before,\\n  But the soul is also real, it too is positive and direct,\\n  No reasoning, no proof has establish\\'d it,\\n  Undeniable growth has establish\\'d it.\\n\\n       4\\n  These to echo the tones of souls and the phrases of souls,\\n  (If they did not echo the phrases of souls what were they then?\\n  If they had not reference to you in especial what were they then?)\\n\\n  I swear I will never henceforth have to do with the faith that tells\\n      the best,\\n  I will have to do only with that faith that leaves the best untold.\\n\\n  Say on, sayers! sing on, singers!\\n  Delve! mould! pile the words of the earth!\\n  Work on, age after age, nothing is to be lost,\\n  It may have to wait long, but it will certainly come in use,\\n  When the materials are all prepared and ready, the architects shall appear.\\n\\n  I swear to you the architects shall appear without fall,\\n  I swear to you they will understand you and justify you,\\n  The greatest among them shall be he who best knows you, and encloses\\n      all and is faithful to all,\\n  He and the rest shall not forget you, they shall perceive that you\\n      are not an iota less than they,\\n  You shall be fully glorified in them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYouth, Day, Old Age and Night\\n\\n  Youth, large, lusty, loving--youth full of grace, force, fascination,\\n  Do you know that Old Age may come after you with equal grace,\\n      force, fascination?\\n\\n  Day full-blown and splendid-day of the immense sun, action,\\n      ambition, laughter,\\n  The Night follows close with millions of suns, and sleep and\\n

(said the boy\\'s soul,)\\n  Is it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it really to me?\\n  For I, that was a child, my tongue\\'s use sleeping, now I have heard you,\\n  Now in a moment I know what I am for, I awake,\\n  And already a thousand singers, a thousand songs, clearer, louder\\n      and more sorrowful than yours,\\n  A thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me, never to die.\\n\\n  O you singer solitary, singing by yourself, projecting me,\\n  O solitary me listening, never more shall I cease perpetuating you,\\n  Never more shall I escape, never more the reverberations,\\n  Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me,\\n  Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before what\\n      there in the night,\\n  By the sea under the yellow and sagging moon,\\n  The messenger there arous\\'d, the fire, the sweet hell within,\\n  The unknown want, the destiny of me.\\n\\n  O give me the clue! (it lurks in the night here somewhere,)\\n  O if I am to have so much, let me have more!\\n\\n  A word then, (for I will conquer it,)\\n  The word final, superior to all,\\n  Subtle, sent up--what is it?--I listen;\\n  Are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea-waves?\\n  Is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?\\n\\n  Whereto answering, the sea,\\n  Delaying not, hurrying not,\\n  Whisper\\'d me through the night, and very plainly before daybreak,\\n  Lisp\\'d to me the low and delicious word death,\\n  And again death, death, death, death\\n  Hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arous\\'d child\\'s heart,\\n  But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet,\\n  Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over,\\n  Death, death, death, death, death.\\n\\n  Which I do not forget.\\n  But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother,\\n  That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok\\'s gray beach,\\n  With the thousand responsive songs at random,\\n  My own songs awaked from that hour,\\n  And with them the key, the word up from the waves,\\n  The word of the sweetest song and all songs,\\n  That strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,\\n  (Or like some old crone rocking the cradle, swathed in sweet\\n      garments, bending aside,)\\n  The sea whisper\\'d me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I Ebb\\'d with the Ocean of Life\\n\\n       1\\n  As I ebb\\'d with the ocean of life,\\n  As I wended the shores I know,\\n  As I walk\\'d where the ripples continually wash you Paumanok,\\n  Where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant,\\n  Where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways,\\n  I musing late in the autumn day, gazing off southward,\\n  Held by this electric self out of the pride of which I utter poems,\\n  Was seiz\\'d by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot,\\n  The rim, the sediment that stands for all the water and all the land\\n      of the globe.\\n\\n  Fascinated, my eyes reverting from the south, dropt, to follow those\\n      slender windrows,\\n  Chaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the sea-gluten,\\n  Scum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of salt-lettuce, left by the tide,\\n  Miles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of me,\\n  Paumanok there and then as I thought the old thought of likenesses,\\n  These you presented to me you fish-shaped island,\\n  As I wended the shores I know,\\n  As I walk\\'d with that electric self seeking types.\\n\\n       2\\n  As I wend to the shores I know not,\\n  As I list to the dirge, the voices of men and women wreck\\'d,\\n  As I inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me,\\n  As the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer,\\n  I too but signify at the utmost a little wash\\'d-up drift,\\n  A few sands and dead leaves to gather,\\n  Gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift.\\n\\n  O baffled, balk\\'d, bent to the very earth,\\n  Oppress\\'d with myself that I have dared to open my mouth,\\n  Aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon me I have\\n      not once had the least idea who or what I am,\\n  But that before all my arrogant poems the real Me stands yet\\n      untouch\\'d, untold, altogether unreach\\'d,\\n  Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs and bows,\\n  With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have written,\\n  Pointing in silence to these songs, and then to the sand beneath.\\n\\n  I perceive I have not really understood any thing, not a single\\n      object, and that no man ever can,\\n  Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart upon\\n      me and sting me,\\n  Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all.\\n\\n       3\\n  You oceans both, I close with you,\\n  We murmur alike reproachfully rolling sands and drift, knowing not why,\\n  These little shreds indeed standing for you and me and all.\\n\\n  You friable shore with trails of debris,\\n  You fish-shaped island, I take what is underfoot,\\n  What is yours is mine my father.\\n\\n  I too Paumanok,\\n  I too have bubbled up, floated the measureless float, and been\\n      wash\\'d on your shores,\\n  I too am but a trail of drift and debris,\\n  I too leave little wrecks upon you, you fish-shaped island.\\n\\n  I throw myself upon your breast my father,\\n  I cling to you so that you cannot unloose me,\\n  I hold you so firm till you answer me something.\\n\\n  Kiss me my father,\\n  Touch me with your lips as I touch those I love,\\n  Breathe to me while I hold you close the secret of the murmuring I envy.\\n\\n       4\\n  Ebb, ocean of life, (the flow will return,)\\n  Cease not your moaning you fierce old mother,\\n  Endlessly cry for your castaways, but fear not, deny not me,\\n  Rustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet as I touch you or\\n      gather from you.\\n\\n  I mean tenderly by you and all,\\n  I gather for myself and for this phantom looking down where we lead,\\n      and following me and mine.\\n\\n  Me and mine, loose windrows, little corpses,\\n  Froth, snowy white, and bubbles,\\n  (See, from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last,\\n  See, the prismatic colors glistening and rolling,)\\n  Tufts of straw, sands, fragments,\\n  Buoy\\'d hither from many moods, one contradicting another,\\n  From the storm, the long calm, the darkness, the swell,\\n  Musing, pondering, a breath, a briny tear, a dab of liquid or soil,\\n  Up just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thrown,\\n  A limp blossom or two, torn, just as much over waves floating,\\n      drifted at random,\\n  Just as much for us that sobbing dirge of Nature,\\n  Just as much whence we come that blare of the cloud-trumpets,\\n  We, capricious, brought hither we know not whence, spread out before you,\\n  You up there walking or sitting,\\n  Whoever you are, we too lie in drifts at your feet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTears\\n\\n  Tears! tears! tears!\\n  In the night, in solitude, tears,\\n  On the white shore dripping, dripping, suck\\'d in by the sand,\\n  Tears, not a star shining, all dark and desolate,\\n  Moist tears from the eyes of a muffled head;\\n  O who is that ghost? that form in the dark, with tears?\\n  What shapeless lump is that, bent, crouch\\'d there on the sand?\\n  Streaming tears, sobbing tears, throes, choked with wild cries;\\n  O storm, embodied, rising, careering with swift steps along the beach!\\n  O wild and dismal night storm, with wind--O belching and desperate!\\n  O shade so sedate and decorous by day, with calm countenance and\\n      regulated pace,\\n  But away at night as you fly, none looking--O then the unloosen\\'d ocean,\\n  Of tears! tears! tears!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo the Man-of-War-Bird\\n\\n  Thou who hast slept all night upon the storm,\\n  Waking renew\\'d on thy prodigious pinions,\\n  (Burst the wild storm? above it thou

And all that went down doing their duty,\\n  Reminiscent of them, twined from all intrepid captains young or old,\\n  A pennant universal, subtly waving all time, o\\'er all brave sailors,\\n  All seas, all ships.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPatroling Barnegat\\n\\n  Wild, wild the storm, and the sea high running,\\n  Steady the roar of the gale, with incessant undertone muttering,\\n  Shouts of demoniac

careering,\\n  A group of dim, weird forms, struggling, the night confronting,\\n  That savage trinity warily watching.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the Sea-Ship\\n\\n  After the sea-ship, after the whistling winds,\\n  After the white-gray sails taut to their spars and ropes,\\n  Below, a myriad myriad waves hastening, lifting up their necks,\\n  Tending in ceaseless flow toward the track of the ship,\\n  Waves of the ocean bubbling and gurgling, blithely prying,\\n  Waves, undulating waves, liquid, uneven, emulous waves,\\n  Toward that whirling current, laughing and buoyant, with curves,\\n  Where the great vessel sailing and tacking displaced the surface,\\n  Larger and smaller waves in the spread of the ocean yearnfully flowing,\\n  The wake of the sea-ship after she passes, flashing and frolicsome\\n      under the sun,\\n  A motley procession with many a fleck of foam and many fragments,\\n  Following the stately and rapid ship, in the wake following.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK XX.  BY THE ROADSIDE\\n\\n\\nA Boston Ballad [1854]\\n\\n  To get betimes in Boston town I rose this morning early,\\n  Here\\'s a good place at the corner, I must stand and see the show.\\n\\n  Clear the way there Jonathan!\\n  Way for the President\\'s marshal--way for the government cannon!\\n  Way for the Federal foot and dragoons, (and the apparitions\\n      copiously tumbling.)\\n\\n  I love to look on the Stars and Stripes, I hope the fifes will play\\n      Yankee Doodle.\\n  How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops!\\n  Every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston town.\\n\\n  A fog follows, antiques of the same come limping,\\n  Some appear wooden-legged, and some appear bandaged and bloodless.\\n\\n  Why this is indeed a show--it has called the dead out of the earth!\\n  The old graveyards of the hills have hurried to see!\\n  Phantoms! phantoms countless by flank and rear!\\n  Cock\\'d hats of mothy mould--crutches made of mist!\\n  Arms in slings--old men leaning on young men\\'s shoulders.\\n\\n  What troubles you Yankee phantoms? what is all this chattering of\\n      bare gums?\\n  Does the ague convulse your limbs? do you mistake your crutches for\\n      firelocks and level them?\\n\\n  If you blind your eyes with tears you will not see the President\\'s marshal,\\n  If you groan such groans you might balk the government cannon.\\n\\n  For shame old maniacs--bring down those toss\\'d arms, and let your\\n      white hair be,\\n  Here gape your great grandsons, their wives gaze at them from the windows,\\n  See how well dress\\'d, see how orderly they conduct themselves.\\n\\n  Worse and worse--can\\'t you stand it? are you retreating?\\n  Is this hour with the living too dead for you?\\n\\n  Retreat then--pell-mell!\\n  To your graves--back--back to the hills old limpers!\\n  I do not think you belong here anyhow.\\n\\n  But there is one thing that belongs here--shall I tell you what it\\n      is, gentlemen of Boston?\\n\\n  I will whisper it to the Mayor, he shall send a committee to England,\\n  They shall get a grant from the Parliament, go with a cart to the\\n      royal vault,\\n  Dig out King George\\'s coffin, unwrap him quick from the\\n      graveclothes, box up his bones for a journey,\\n  Find a swift Yankee clipper--here is freight for you, black-bellied clipper,\\n  Up with your anchor--shake out your sails--steer straight toward\\n      Boston bay.\\n\\n  Now call for the President\\'s marshal again, bring out the government cannon,\\n  Fetch home the roarers from Congress, make another procession,\\n      guard it with foot and dragoons.\\n\\n  This centre-piece for them;\\n  Look, all orderly citizens--look from the windows, women!\\n\\n  The committee open the box, set up the regal ribs, glue those that\\n      will not stay,\\n  Clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the skull.\\n  You have got your revenge, old buster--the crown is come to its own,\\n      and more than its own.\\n\\n  Stick your hands in your pockets, Jonathan--you are a made man from\\n      this day,\\n  You are mighty cute--and here is one of your bargains.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEurope [The 72d and 73d Years of These States]\\n\\n  Suddenly out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves,\\n  Like lightning it le\\'pt forth half startled at itself,\\n  Its feet upon the ashes and the rags, its hands tight to the throats\\n      of kings.\\n\\n  O hope and faith!\\n  O aching close of exiled patriots\\' lives!\\n  O many a sicken\\'d heart!\\n  Turn back unto this day and make yourselves afresh.\\n\\n  And you, paid to defile the People--you liars, mark!\\n  Not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,\\n  For court thieving in its manifold mean forms, worming from his\\n      simplicity the poor man\\'s wages,\\n  For many a promise sworn by royal lips and broken and laugh\\'d at in\\n      the breaking,\\n\\n  Then in their power not for all these did the blows strike revenge,\\n      or the heads of the nobles fall;\\n  The People scorn\\'d the ferocity of kings.\\n\\n  But the sweetness of mercy brew\\'d bitter destruction, and the\\n      frighten\\'d monarchs come back,\\n  Each comes in state with his train, hangman, priest, tax-gatherer,\\n  Soldier, lawyer, lord, jailer, and sycophant.\\n\\n  Yet behind all lowering stealing, lo, a shape,\\n  Vague as the night, draped interminably, head, front and form, in\\n      scarlet folds,\\n  Whose face and eyes none may see,\\n  Out of its robes only this, the red robes lifted by the arm,\\n  One finger crook\\'d pointed high over the top, like the head of a\\n      snake appears.\\n\\n  Meanwhile corpses lie in new-made graves, bloody corpses of young men,\\n  The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets of princes are\\n      flying, the creatures of power laugh aloud,\\n  And all these things bear fruits, and they are good.\\n\\n  Those corpses of young men,\\n  Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets, those hearts pierc\\'d by\\n      the gray lead,\\n  Cold and motionless as they seem live elsewhere with unslaughter\\'d vitality.\\n\\n  They live in other young men O kings!\\n  They live in brothers again ready to defy you,\\n  They were purified by death, they were taught and exalted.\\n\\n  Not a grave of the murder\\'d for freedom but grows seed for freedom,\\n      in its turn to bear seed,\\n  Which the winds carry afar and re-sow, and the rains and the snows nourish.\\n\\n  Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose,\\n  But it stalks invisibly over the earth, whispering, counseling, cautioning.\\n  Liberty, let others despair of you--I never despair of you.\\n\\n  Is the house shut?

drilling, they are yet surrounded with smiles,\\n  Around them at hand the well-drest friends and the women,\\n  While splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down,\\n  Green the midsummer verdure and fresh blows the dallying breeze,\\n  O\\'er proud and peaceful cities and arm of the sea between.\\n\\n  But drill and parade are over, they march back to quarters,\\n  Only hear that approval of hands! hear what a clapping!\\n\\n  As wending the crowds now part and disperse--but we old man,\\n  Not for nothing have I brought you hither--we must remain,\\n  You to speak in your turn, and I to listen and tell.\\n\\n       [The Centenarian]\\n  When I clutch\\'d your hand it was not with terror,\\n  But suddenly pouring about me here on every side,\\n  And below there where the boys were drilling, and up the slopes they ran,\\n  And where tents are pitch\\'d, and wherever you see south and south-\\n      east and south-west,\\n  Over hills, across lowlands, and in the skirts of woods,\\n  And along the shores, in mire (now fill\\'d over) came again and\\n      suddenly raged,\\n  As eighty-five years agone no mere parade receiv\\'d with applause of friends,\\n  But a battle which I took part in myself--aye, long ago as it is, I\\n      took part in it,\\n  Walking then this hilltop, this same ground.\\n\\n  Aye, this is the ground,\\n  My blind eyes even as I speak behold it re-peopled from graves,\\n  The years recede, pavements and stately houses disappear,\\n  Rude forts appear again, the old hoop\\'d guns are mounted,\\n  I see the lines of rais\\'d earth stretching from river to bay,\\n  I mark the vista of waters, I mark the uplands and slopes;\\n  Here we lay encamp\\'d, it was this time in summer also.\\n\\n  As I talk I remember all, I remember the Declaration,\\n  It was read here, the whole army paraded, it was read to us here,\\n  By his staff surrounded the General stood in the middle, he held up\\n      his unsheath\\'d sword,\\n  It glitter\\'d in the sun in full sight of the army.\\n\\n  Twas a bold act then--the English war-ships had just arrived,\\n  We could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor,\\n  And the transports swarming with soldiers.\\n\\n  A few days more and they landed, and then the battle.\\n\\n  Twenty thousand were brought against us,\\n  A veteran force furnish\\'d with good artillery.\\n\\n  I tell not now the whole of the battle,\\n  But one brigade early in the forenoon order\\'d forward to engage the\\n      red-coats,\\n  Of that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march\\'d,\\n  And how long and well it stood confronting death.\\n\\n  Who do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting death?\\n  It was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,\\n  Rais\\'d in Virginia and Maryland, and most of them known personally\\n      to the General.\\n\\n  Jauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus\\' waters,\\n  Till of a sudden unlook\\'d for by defiles through the woods, gain\\'d at night,\\n  The British advancing, rounding in from the east, fiercely playing\\n      their guns,\\n  That brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy\\'s mercy.\\n\\n  The General watch\\'d them from this hill,\\n  They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment,\\n  Then drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in the middle,\\n  But O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them!\\n\\n  It sickens me yet, that slaughter!\\n  I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General.\\n  I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.\\n\\n  Meanwhile the British manoeuvr\\'d to draw us out for a pitch\\'d battle,\\n  But we dared not trust the chances of a pitch\\'d battle.\\n\\n  We fought the fight in detachments,\\n  Sallying forth we fought at several points, but in each the luck was\\n      against us,\\n  Our foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push\\'d us back\\n      to the works on this hill,\\n  Till we turn\\'d menacing here, and then he left us.\\n\\n  That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand\\n      strong,\\n  Few return\\'d, nearly all remain in Brooklyn.\\n\\n  That and here my General\\'s first battle,\\n  No women looking on nor sunshine to bask in, it did not conclude\\n      with applause,\\n  Nobody clapp\\'d hands here then.\\n\\n  But in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain,\\n  Wearied that night we lay foil\\'d and sullen,\\n  While scornfully laugh\\'d many an arrogant lord off against us encamp\\'d,\\n  Quite within hearing, feasting, clinking wineglasses together over\\n      their victory.\\n\\n  So dull and damp and another day,\\n  But the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,\\n  Silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him, my\\n      General retreated.\\n\\n  I saw him at the river-side,\\n  Down by the ferry lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;\\n  My General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass\\'d over,\\n  And then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for\\n      the last time.\\n\\n  Every one else seem\\'d fill\\'d with gloom,\\n  Many no doubt thought of capitulation.\\n\\n  But when my General pass\\'d me,\\n  As he stood in his boat and look\\'d toward the coming sun,\\n  I saw something different from capitulation.\\n\\n       [Terminus]\\n  Enough, the Centenarian\\'s story ends,\\n  The two, the past and present, have interchanged,\\n  I myself as connecter, as chansonnier of a great future, am now speaking.\\n\\n  And is this the ground Washington trod?\\n  And these waters I listlessly daily cross, are these the waters he cross\\'d,\\n  As resolute in defeat as other generals in their proudest triumphs?\\n\\n  I must copy the story, and send it eastward and westward,\\n  I must preserve that look as it beam\\'d on you rivers of Brooklyn.\\n\\n  See--as the annual round returns the phantoms return,\\n  It is the 27th of August and the British have landed,\\n  The battle begins and goes against us, behold through the smoke\\n      Washington\\'s face,\\n  The brigade of Virginia and Maryland have march\\'d forth to intercept\\n      the enemy,\\n  They are cut off, murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them,\\n  Rank after rank falls, while over them silently droops the flag,\\n  Baptized that day in many a young man\\'s bloody wounds.\\n  In death, defeat, and sisters\\', mothers\\' tears.\\n\\n  Ah, hills

see before me now a traveling army halting,\\n  Below a fertile valley spread, with barns and the orchards of summer,\\n  Behind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt, in places rising high,\\n  Broken, with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes dingily seen,\\n  The numerous camp-fires scatter\\'d near and far, some away up on the\\n      mountain,\\n  The shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized, flickering,\\n  And over all the sky--the sky! far, far out of reach, studded,\\n      breaking out, the eternal stars.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Army Corps on the March\\n\\n  With its cloud of skirmishers in advance,\\n  With now the sound of a single shot snapping like a whip, and now an\\n      irregular volley,\\n  The swarming ranks press on and on, the dense brigades press on,\\n  Glittering dimly, toiling under the sun--the dust-cover\\'d men,\\n  In columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground,\\n  With artillery interspers\\'d--the wheels rumble, the horses sweat,\\n  As the army corps advances.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the Bivouac\\'s Fitful Flame\\n\\n  By the bivouac\\'s fitful flame,\\n  A procession winding around me, solemn and sweet and slow--but\\n      first I note,\\n  The tents of the sleeping army, the fields\\' and woods\\' dim outline,\\n  The darkness lit by spots of kindled fire, the silence,\\n  Like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving,\\n  The shrubs and trees, (as I lift my eyes they seem to be stealthily\\n      watching me,)\\n  While wind in procession thoughts, O tender and wondrous thoughts,\\n  Of life and death, of home and the past and loved, and of those that\\n      are far away;\\n  A solemn and slow procession there as I sit on the ground,\\n  By the bivouac\\'s fitful flame.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCome Up from the Fields Father\\n\\n  Come up from the fields father, here\\'s a letter from our Pete,\\n  And come to the front door mother, here\\'s a letter from thy dear

lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain, and\\n      with wondrous clouds,\\n  Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm prospers well.\\n\\n  Down in the fields all prospers well,\\n  But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter\\'s call.\\n  And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right away.\\n\\n  Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps trembling,\\n  She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap.\\n\\n  Open the envelope quickly,\\n  O this is not our son\\'s writing, yet his name is sign\\'d,\\n  O a strange hand writes for our dear son, O stricken mother\\'s soul!\\n  All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the main\\n      words only,\\n  Sentences broken, gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish,\\n      taken to hospital,\\n  At present low, but will soon be better.\\n\\n  Ah now the single figure to me,\\n  Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms,\\n  Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,\\n  By the jamb of a door leans.\\n\\n  Grieve not so, dear mother, (the just-grown daughter speaks through\\n      her sobs,\\n  The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay\\'d,)\\n  See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better.\\n\\n  Alas poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may-be needs to be\\n      better, that brave and simple soul,)\\n  While they stand at home at the door he is dead already,\\n  The only son is dead.\\n\\n  But the mother needs to be better,\\n  She with thin form presently drest in black,\\n  By day her meals untouch\\'d, then at night fitfully sleeping, often waking,\\n  In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,\\n  O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape and withdraw,\\n  To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVigil Strange I Kept on the Field One Night\\n\\n  Vigil strange I kept on the field one night;\\n  When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day,\\n  One look I but gave which your dear eyes return\\'d with a look I\\n      shall never forget,\\n  One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach\\'d up as you lay on the ground,\\n  Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle,\\n  Till late in the night reliev\\'d to the place at last again I made my way,\\n  Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of\\n      responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)\\n  Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the\\n      moderate night-wind,\\n  Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the\\n      battlefield spreading,\\n  Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night,\\n  But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed,\\n  Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my\\n      chin in my hands,\\n  Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest\\n      comrade--not a tear, not a word,\\n  Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my soldier,\\n  As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole,\\n  Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your death,\\n  I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall\\n      surely meet again,)\\n  Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appear\\'d,\\n  My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop\\'d well his form,\\n  Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and\\n      carefully under feet,\\n  And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his\\n      grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited,\\n  Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field dim,\\n  Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)\\n  Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day\\n      brighten\\'d,\\n  I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket,\\n  And buried him where he fell.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA March in the Ranks Hard-Prest, and the Road Unknown\\n\\n  A march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown,\\n  A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness,\\n  Our army foil\\'d with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating,\\n  Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted building,\\n  We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim-lighted building,\\n  \\'Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an impromptu hospital,\\n  Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and\\n      poems ever made,\\n  Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and lamps,\\n  And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and\\n      clouds of smoke,\\n  By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some\\n      in the pews laid down,\\n  At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of\\n      bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,)\\n  I stanch the blood temporarily, (the youngster\\'s face is white as a lily,)\\n  Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o\\'er the scene fain to absorb it all,\\n  Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity,\\n      some of them dead,\\n  Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether,\\n      odor of blood,\\n  The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also fill\\'d,\\n  Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the\\n      death-spasm sweating,\\n  An occasional scream or cry, the doctor\\'s shouted orders or calls,\\n  The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of\\n      the torches,\\n  These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odor,\\n  Then hear outside the orders given, Fall in, my men, fall in;\\n  But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives he me,\\n  Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,\\n  Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,\\n  The unknown road still marching.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA Sight in Camp in the Daybreak Gray and Dim\\n\\n  A sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim,\\n  As from my tent I emerge so early sleepless,\\n  As slow I walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital tent,\\n  Three forms I see on stretchers lying, brought out there untended lying,\\n  Over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woolen blanket,\\n  Gray and heavy blanket, folding, covering all.\\n\\n  Curious I halt and silent stand,\\n  Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest the first\\n      just lift the blanket;\\n  Who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim, with well-gray\\'d hair,\\n      and flesh all sunken about the eyes?\\n  Who are you my dear comrade?\\n  Then to the second I step--and who are you my child and darling?\\n  Who are you sweet boy with cheeks yet blooming?\\n  Then to the third--a face nor child nor old, very calm, as of\\n      beautiful yellow-white ivory;\\n  Young man I think I know you--I think this face is the face of the\\n      Christ himself,\\n  Dead and divine and brother of all, and here again he lies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs

how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?\\n  And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love?\\n\\n  Sea-winds blown from east and west,\\n  Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea, till\\n      there on the prairies meeting,\\n  These and with these and the breath of my chant,\\n  I\\'ll perfume the grave of him I love.\\n\\n       11\\n  O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?\\n  And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,\\n  To adorn the burial-house of him I love?\\n  Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes,\\n  With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright,\\n  With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking\\n      sun, burning, expanding the air,\\n  With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves\\n      of the trees prolific,\\n  In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a\\n      wind-dapple here and there,\\n  With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky,\\n      and shadows,\\n  And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys,\\n  And all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen\\n      homeward returning.\\n\\n       12\\n  Lo, body and soul--this land,\\n  My own Manhattan with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides,\\n      and the ships,\\n  The varied and ample land, the South and the North in the light,\\n      Ohio\\'s shores and flashing Missouri,\\n  And ever the far-spreading prairies cover\\'d with grass and corn.\\n\\n  Lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty,\\n  The violet and purple morn with just-felt breezes,\\n  The gentle soft-born measureless light,\\n  The miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill\\'d noon,\\n  The coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the stars,\\n  Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land.\\n\\n       13\\n  Sing on, sing on you gray-brown bird,\\n  Sing from the swamps, the recesses, pour your chant from the bushes,\\n  Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines.\\n\\n  Sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song,\\n  Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe.\\n\\n  O liquid and free and tender!\\n  O wild and loose to my soul--O wondrous singer!\\n  You only I hear--yet the star holds me, (but will soon depart,)\\n  Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me.\\n\\n       14\\n  Now while I sat in the day and look\\'d forth,\\n  In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring, and\\n      the farmers preparing their crops,\\n  In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and forests,\\n  In the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb\\'d winds and the storms,)\\n  Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the\\n      voices of children and women,\\n  The many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sail\\'d,\\n  And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy\\n      with labor,\\n  And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with\\n      its meals and minutia of daily usages,\\n  And the streets how their throbbings throbb\\'d, and the cities pent--\\n      lo, then and there,\\n  Falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the rest,\\n  Appear\\'d the cloud, appear\\'d the long black trail,\\n  And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death.\\n\\n  Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,\\n  And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,\\n  And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of\\n      companions,\\n  I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not,\\n  Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,\\n  To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.\\n\\n  And the singer so shy to the rest receiv\\'d me,\\n  The gray-brown bird I know receiv\\'d us comrades three,\\n  And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love.\\n\\n  From deep secluded recesses,\\n  From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still,\\n  Came the carol of the bird.\\n\\n  And the charm of the carol rapt me,\\n  As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night,\\n  And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.\\n\\n  Come lovely and soothing death,\\n  Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,\\n  In the day, in the night, to all, to each,\\n  Sooner or later delicate death.\\n\\n  Prais\\'d be the fathomless universe,\\n  For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,\\n  And for love, sweet love--but praise! praise! praise!\\n  For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.\\n\\n  Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,\\n  Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?\\n  Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,\\n  I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.\\n\\n  Approach strong deliveress,\\n  When it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead,\\n  Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee,\\n  Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death.\\n\\n  From me to thee glad serenades,\\n  Dances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and feastings for thee,\\n  And the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread shy are fitting,\\n  And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.\\n\\n  The night in silence under many a star,\\n  The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know,\\n  And the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil\\'d death,\\n  And the body gratefully nestling close to thee.\\n\\n  Over the tree-tops I float thee a song,\\n  Over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the\\n      prairies wide,\\n  Over the dense-pack\\'d cities all and the teeming wharves and ways,\\n  I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death.\\n\\n       15\\n  To the tally of my soul,\\n  Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,\\n  With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.\\n\\n  Loud in the pines and cedars dim,\\n  Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume,\\n  And I with my comrades there in the night.\\n\\n  While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,\\n  As to long panoramas of visions.\\n\\n  And I saw askant the armies,\\n  I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,\\n  Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc\\'d with missiles I saw them,\\n  And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody,\\n  And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in silence,)\\n  And the staffs all splinter\\'d and broken.\\n\\n  I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,\\n  And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,\\n  I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,\\n  But I saw they were not as was thought,\\n  They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer\\'d not,\\n  The living remain\\'d and suffer\\'d, the mother suffer\\'d,\\n  And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer\\'d,\\n  And the armies that remain\\'d suffer\\'d.\\n\\n       16\\n  Passing the visions, passing the night,\\n  Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades\\' hands,\\n  Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul,\\n  Victorious song, death\\'s outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song,\\n  As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling,\\n      flooding the night,\\n  Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again\\n      bursting with joy,\\n  Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven,\\n  As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,\\n  Passing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves,\\n  I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring.\\n\\n  I cease from my song for thee,\\n  From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee,\\n  O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.\\n\\n  Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night,\\n  The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,\\n  And the tallying chant, the echo arous\\'d in my soul,\\n  With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe,\\n  With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,\\n  Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for\\n      the dead I loved so well,\\n  For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands--and this for\\n      his dear sake,\\n  Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,\\n  There in the fragrant pines and

measur\\'d march of soldiers, nor the tents of camps,\\n  Nor the regiments hastily coming up deploying in line of battle;\\n  No more the sad, unnatural shows of war.\\n\\n  Ask\\'d room those flush\\'d immortal ranks, the first forth-stepping armies?\\n  Ask room alas the ghastly ranks, the armies dread that follow\\'d.\\n\\n  (Pass, pass, ye proud brigades, with your tramping sinewy

again,\\n  For an army heaves in sight, O another gathering army,\\n  Swarming, trailing on the rear, O you dread accruing army,\\n  O you regiments so piteous, with your mortal diarrhoea, with your

far-stretching beauteous landscape, the roads and lanes the\\n      high-piled farm-wagons, and the fruits and barns,\\n  Should the dead intrude?\\n\\n  Ah the dead to me mar not, they fit well in Nature,\\n  They fit very well in the landscape under the trees and grass,\\n  And along the edge of the sky in the horizon\\'s far margin.\\n\\n  Nor do I forget you Departed,\\n  Nor in winter or

day the return of the heroes,\\n  (Yet the heroes never surpass\\'d shall never return,\\n  Them that day I saw not.)\\n\\n  I saw the interminable corps, I saw the processions of armies,\\n  I saw them approaching, defiling by with divisions,\\n  Streaming northward, their work done, camping awhile in clusters of\\n      mighty camps.\\n\\n  No holiday soldiers--youthful, yet veterans,\\n  Worn, swart, handsome, strong, of the stock of homestead and workshop,\\n  Harden\\'d of many a long campaign and sweaty march,\\n  Inured on many a hard-fought bloody field.\\n\\n  A pause--the armies wait,\\n  A million flush\\'d embattled conquerors wait,\\n  The world too waits, then soft as breaking night and sure as dawn,\\n  They melt, they disappear.\\n\\n  Exult O lands! victorious lands!\\n  Not there your victory on those red shuddering fields,\\n  But here and hence your victory.\\n\\n  Melt, melt away ye armies--disperse ye blue-clad soldiers,\\n  Resolve ye back again, give up for good your deadly arms,\\n  Other the arms the fields henceforth for you, or South or North,\\n  With saner wars, sweet wars, life-giving wars.\\n\\n       7\\n  Loud O my throat, and clear O soul!\\n  The season of thanks and the voice of full-yielding,\\n  The chant of joy and power for boundless fertility.\\n\\n  All till\\'d and untill\\'d fields expand before me,\\n  I see the true arenas of my race, or first or last,\\n  Man\\'s innocent and strong arenas.\\n\\n  I see the heroes at other toils,\\n  I see well-wielded in their hands the better weapons.\\n\\n  I see where the Mother of All,\\n  With full-spanning eye gazes forth, dwells long,\\n  And counts the varied gathering of the products.\\n\\n  Busy the far, the sunlit panorama,\\n  Prairie, orchard, and yellow grain of the North,\\n  Cotton and rice of the South and Louisianian cane,\\n  Open unseeded fallows, rich fields of clover and timothy,\\n  Kine and horses feeding, and droves of sheep and swine,\\n  And many a stately river flowing and many a jocund brook,\\n  And healthy uplands with herby-perfumed breezes,\\n  And the good green grass, that delicate miracle the ever-recurring grass.\\n\\n       8\\n  Toil on heroes! harvest the products!\\n  Not alone on those warlike fields the Mother of All,\\n  With dilated form and lambent eyes watch\\'d you.\\n\\n  Toil on heroes! toil well! handle the weapons well!\\n  The Mother of All, yet here as ever she watches you.\\n\\n  Well-pleased America thou beholdest,\\n  Over the fields of the West those crawling monsters,\\n  The human-divine inventions, the labor-saving implements;\\n  Beholdest moving in every direction imbued as with life the\\n      revolving hay-rakes,\\n  The steam-power reaping-machines and the horse-power machines\\n  The engines, thrashers of grain and cleaners of grain, well\\n      separating the straw, the nimble work of the patent pitchfork,\\n  Beholdest the newer saw-mill, the southern cotton-gin, and the\\n      rice-cleanser.\\n\\n  Beneath thy look O Maternal,\\n  With these and else and with their own strong hands the heroes harvest.\\n\\n  All gather and all harvest,\\n  Yet but for thee O Powerful, not a scythe might swing as now in security,\\n  Not a maize-stalk dangle as now its silken tassels in peace.\\n\\n  Under thee only they harvest, even but a wisp of hay under thy great\\n      face only,\\n  Harvest the wheat of Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, every barbed spear\\n      under thee,\\n  Harvest the maize of Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, each ear in its\\n      light-green sheath,\\n  Gather the hay to its myriad mows in the odorous tranquil barns,\\n  Oats to their bins, the white potato, the buckwheat of Michigan, to theirs;\\n  Gather the cotton in Mississippi or Alabama, dig and hoard the\\n      golden the sweet potato of Georgia and the Carolinas,\\n  Clip the wool of California or Pennsylvania,\\n  Cut the flax in the Middle States, or hemp

cow\\'s calf,\\n  And the noisy brood of the barnyard or by the mire of the pond-side,\\n  And the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there, and the\\n      beautiful curious liquid,\\n  And the water-plants with their graceful flat heads, all became part of him.\\n\\n  The field-sprouts of Fourth-month and Fifth-month became part of him,\\n  Winter-grain sprouts and those of the light-yellow corn, and the\\n      esculent roots of the garden,\\n  And the apple-trees cover\\'d with blossoms and the fruit afterward,\\n      and wood-berries, and the commonest weeds by the

him afterward every day, they became part of him.\\n\\n  The mother at home quietly placing the dishes on the supper-table,\\n  The mother with mild words, clean her cap and gown, a wholesome\\n      odor falling off her person and clothes as she walks by,\\n  The father, strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean, anger\\'d, unjust,\\n  The blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the crafty lure,\\n  The family usages, the language, the company, the furniture, the\\n      yearning and swelling heart,\\n  Affection that will not be gainsay\\'d, the sense of what is real, the\\n      thought if after all it should prove unreal,\\n  The doubts of day-time and the doubts of night-time, the curious\\n      whether and how,\\n  Whether that which appears so is so, or is it all flashes and specks?\\n  Men and women crowding fast in the streets, if they are not flashes\\n      and specks what are they?\\n  The streets themselves and the facades of houses, and goods in the windows,\\n  Vehicles, teams, the heavy-plank\\'d wharves, the huge crossing at\\n      the ferries,\\n  The village on the highland seen from afar at sunset, the river between,\\n  Shadows, aureola and mist, the light falling on roofs and gables of\\n      white or brown two miles off,\\n  The schooner near by sleepily dropping down the tide, the little\\n      boat slack-tow\\'d astern,\\n  The hurrying tumbling waves, quick-broken crests, slapping,\\n  The strata of color\\'d clouds, the long bar of maroon-tint away\\n      solitary by itself, the spread of purity it lies motionless in,\\n  The horizon\\'s edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt marsh\\n      and shore mud,\\n  These became part of that child who went forth every day, and who\\n      now goes, and will always go forth every day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOld Ireland\\n\\n  Far hence amid an isle of wondrous beauty,\\n  Crouching over a grave an ancient sorrowful mother,\\n  Once a queen, now lean and tatter\\'d seated on

 Of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow because most full of love.\\n\\n  Yet a word ancient mother,\\n  You need crouch there no longer on the cold ground with forehead\\n      between your

by the gate,\\n  As idly sauntering wending my way from the clangor,\\n  I curious pause, for lo, an outcast form, a poor dead prostitute brought,\\n  Her corpse they deposit unclaim\\'d, it lies on the damp brick pavement,\\n  The divine woman, her body, I see the body, I look on it alone,\\n  That house once full of passion and beauty, all else I notice not,\\n  Nor stillness so cold, nor running water from faucet, nor odors\\n      morbific impress me,\\n  But the house alone--that wondrous house--that delicate fair house\\n      --that ruin!\\n  That immortal house more than all the

house!\\n  Fair, fearful wreck--tenement of a soul--itself a soul,\\n  Unclaim\\'d, avoided house--take one breath from my tremulous lips,\\n  Take one tear dropt aside as I go for thought of you,\\n  Dead house of love--house of madness and sin, crumbled, crush\\'d,\\n  House of life, erewhile talking and laughing--but ah, poor house,\\n      dead even then,\\n  Months, years, an echoing, garnish\\'d house--but dead, dead, dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis Compost\\n\\n       1\\n  Something startles me where I thought I was safest,\\n  I withdraw from the still woods I loved,\\n  I will not go

is quell\\'d by one or two failures, or any\\n      number of failures,\\n  Or by the indifference or ingratitude of the people, or by any\\n      unfaithfulness,\\n  Or the show of the tushes of power, soldiers, cannon, penal statutes.\\n\\n  What we believe in waits latent forever through all the continents,\\n  Invites no one, promises nothing, sits in calmness and light, is\\n      positive and composed, knows no discouragement,\\n  Waiting patiently, waiting its time.\\n\\n  (Not songs of loyalty alone are these,\\n  But songs of insurrection also,\\n  For I am the sworn poet of every dauntless rebel the world over,\\n  And he going with me leaves peace and routine behind him,\\n  And stakes his life to be lost at any moment.)\\n\\n  The battle rages with many a loud alarm and frequent advance and retreat,\\n  The infidel triumphs, or supposes he triumphs,\\n  The prison, scaffold, garrote, handcuffs, iron necklace and\\n      leadballs do their work,\\n  The named and unnamed heroes pass to other spheres,\\n  The great speakers and writers are exiled, they lie sick in distant lands,\\n  The cause is asleep, the strongest throats are choked with their own blood,\\n  The young men droop their eyelashes toward the ground when they meet;\\n  But for all this Liberty has not gone out of the place, nor the\\n      infidel enter\\'d into full possession.\\n\\n  When liberty goes out of a place it is not the first to go, nor the\\n      second or third to go,\\n  It waits for all the rest to go, it is the last.\\n\\n  When there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs,\\n  And when all life and all the souls of men and women are discharged\\n      from any part of the earth,\\n  Then only shall liberty or the idea of liberty be discharged from\\n      that part of the earth,\\n  And the infidel come into full possession.\\n\\n  Then courage European revolter, revoltress!\\n  For till all ceases neither must you cease.\\n\\n  I do not know what you are for, (I do not know what I am for myself,\\n      nor what any thing is for,)\\n  But I will search carefully for it even in being foil\\'d,\\n  In defeat, poverty, misconception, imprisonment--for they too are great.\\n\\n  Did we think victory great?\\n  So it is--but now it seems to me, when it cannot be help\\'d, that\\n      defeat is great,\\n  And that death and dismay are great.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnnamed Land\\n\\n  Nations ten thousand years before these States, and many times ten\\n      thousand years before these States,\\n  Garner\\'d clusters of ages that men and

all remains.\\n\\n  O I know that those men and women were not for nothing, any more\\n      than we are for nothing,\\n  I know that they belong to the scheme of the world every bit as much\\n      as we now belong to it.\\n\\n  Afar they stand, yet near to me they stand,\\n  Some with oval countenances learn\\'d and calm,\\n  Some naked and savage, some like huge collections of insects,\\n

amid temples, palaces, factories,\\n      libraries, shows, courts, theatres, wonderful monuments.\\n  Are those billions of men really gone?\\n  Are those women of the old experience of the earth gone?\\n  Do their lives, cities, arts, rest only with us?\\n  Did they achieve nothing for good for themselves?\\n\\n  I believe of all those men and women that fill\\'d the unnamed lands,\\n      every one exists this hour here or elsewhere, invisible to us.\\n  In exact proportion to what he or she grew from in life, and out of\\n      what he or she did, felt, became, loved, sinn\\'d, in

literature, products,\\n      games, wars, manners, crimes, prisons, slaves, heroes, poets,\\n  I suspect their results curiously await in the yet unseen world,\\n      counterparts of what accrued to

I saunter\\'d pondering,\\n  On Time, Space, Reality--on such as these, and abreast with them Prudence.\\n\\n  The last explanation always remains to be made about prudence,\\n  Little and large alike drop quietly aside from the prudence that\\n      suits immortality.\\n\\n  The soul is of itself,\\n  All verges to it, all has reference to what ensues,\\n  All that a person does, says, thinks, is of consequence,\\n  Not a move can a man or woman make, that affects him or her in a day,\\n      month, any part of the direct lifetime, or the hour of death,\\n  But the same affects him or her onward afterward through the\\n      indirect lifetime.\\n\\n  The indirect is just as much as the direct,\\n  The spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the\\n      body, if not more.\\n\\n  Not one word or deed, not venereal sore, discoloration, privacy of\\n      the onanist,\\n  Putridity of gluttons or rum-drinkers, peculation, cunning,\\n      betrayal, murder, seduction, prostitution,\\n  But has results beyond death as really as before death.\\n\\n  Charity and personal force are the only investments worth any thing.\\n\\n  No specification is necessary, all that a male or female does, that\\n      is vigorous, benevolent, clean, is so much profit to him or her,\\n  In the unshakable order of the universe and through the whole scope\\n      of it forever.\\n\\n  Who has been wise receives interest,\\n  Savage, felon, President, judge, farmer, sailor, mechanic, literat,\\n      young, old, it is the same,\\n  The interest will come round--all will come round.\\n\\n  Singly, wholly, to affect now, affected their time, will forever affect,\\n      all of the past and all of the present and all of the future,\\n  All the brave actions of war and peace,\\n  All help given to relatives, strangers, the poor, old, sorrowful,\\n      young children, widows, the sick, and to shunn\\'d persons,\\n  All self-denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw\\n      others fill the seats of the boats,\\n  All offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a\\n      friend\\'s sake, or opinion\\'s sake,\\n  All pains of enthusiasts scoff\\'d at by their neighbors,\\n  All the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers,\\n  All honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded,\\n  All the grandeur and good of ancient nations whose fragments we inherit,\\n  All the good of the dozens of ancient nations unknown to us by name,\\n      date, location,\\n  All that was ever manfully begun, whether it succeeded or no,\\n  All suggestions of the divine mind of man or the divinity of his\\n      mouth, or the shaping of his great hands,\\n  All that is well thought or said this day on any part of the globe,\\n      or on any of the wandering stars, or on any of the fix\\'d stars,\\n      by those there as we are here,\\n  All that is henceforth to be thought or done by you whoever you are,\\n      or by any one,\\n  These inure, have inured, shall inure, to the identities from which\\n      they sprang, or shall spring.\\n\\n  Did you guess any thing lived only its moment?\\n  The world does not so exist, no parts palpable or impalpable so exist,\\n  No consummation exists without being from some long previous\\n      consummation, and that from some other,\\n  Without the farthest conceivable one coming a bit nearer the\\n      beginning than any.\\n\\n  Whatever satisfies souls is true;\\n  Prudence entirely satisfies the craving and glut of souls,\\n  Itself only finally satisfies the soul,\\n  The soul has that measureless pride which revolts from every lesson\\n      but its own.\\n\\n  Now I breathe the word of the prudence that walks abreast with time,\\n      space, reality,\\n  That answers the pride which refuses every lesson but its own.\\n\\n  What is prudence is indivisible,\\n  Declines to separate one part of life from every part,\\n  Divides not the righteous from the unrighteous or the living from the dead,\\n  Matches every thought or act by its correlative,\\n  Knows no possible forgiveness or deputed atonement,\\n  Knows that the young man who composedly peril\\'d his life and lost it\\n      has done exceedingly well for himself without doubt,\\n  That he who never peril\\'d his life, but retains it to old age in\\n      riches and ease, has probably achiev\\'d nothing for himself worth\\n      mentioning,\\n  Knows that only that person has really learn\\'d who has learn\\'d to\\n      prefer results,\\n  Who favors body and soul the same,\\n  Who perceives the indirect assuredly following the direct,\\n  Who in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither hurries nor\\n      avoids death.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Singer in the

of the old woman\\'s,\\n  I sit low in a straw-bottom chair and carefully darn my grandson\\'s\\n      stockings.\\n\\n  It is I too, the sleepless widow looking out on the winter midnight,\\n  I see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth.\\n\\n  A shroud I see and I am the shroud, I wrap a body and lie in the coffin,\\n  It is dark here under ground, it is not evil or pain here, it is\\n      blank here, for reasons.\\n\\n  (It seems to me that every thing in the light and air ought to be happy,\\n  Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave let him know he has enough.)\\n\\n       3\\n  I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies\\n      of the sea,\\n  His brown hair lies close and even to his head, he strikes out with\\n      courageous arms, he urges himself with his legs,\\n  I see his white body, I see his undaunted eyes,\\n  I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-foremost on\\n      the rocks.\\n\\n  What are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves?\\n  Will you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the prime\\n      of his middle age?\\n\\n  Steady and long he struggles,\\n  He is baffled, bang\\'d, bruis\\'d, he holds out while his strength\\n      holds out,\\n  The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood, they bear him away,\\n      they roll him, swing him, turn him,\\n  His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is\\n      continually bruis\\'d on rocks,\\n  Swiftly and ought of sight is borne the brave corpse.\\n\\n       4\\n  I turn but do not extricate myself,\\n  Confused, a past-reading, another, but with darkness yet.\\n\\n  The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind, the wreck-guns sound,\\n  The tempest lulls, the moon comes floundering through the drifts.\\n\\n  I look where the ship helplessly heads end on, I hear the burst as\\n      she strikes, I hear the howls of dismay, they grow fainter and fainter.\\n\\n  I cannot aid with my wringing fingers,\\n  I can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon me.\\n\\n  I search with the crowd, not one of the company is wash\\'d to us alive,\\n  In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a barn.\\n\\n       5\\n  Now of the older war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn,\\n  Washington stands inside the lines, he stands on the intrench\\'d\\n      hills amid a crowd of officers.\\n  His face is cold and damp, he cannot repress the weeping drops,\\n  He lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes, the color is blanch\\'d\\n      from his cheeks,\\n  He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by\\n      their parents.\\n\\n  The same at last and at last when peace is declared,\\n  He stands in the room of the old tavern, the well-belov\\'d soldiers\\n      all pass through,\\n  The officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,\\n  The chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them on the cheek,\\n  He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another, he shakes hands\\n      and bids good-by to the army.\\n\\n       6\\n  Now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner together,\\n  Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her parents on\\n      the old homestead.\\n\\n  A red squaw came one breakfast-time to the old homestead,\\n  On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush-bottoming chairs,\\n  Her hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-envelop\\'d\\n      her face,\\n  Her step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely as\\n      she spoke.\\n\\n  My mother look\\'d in delight and amazement at the stranger,\\n  She look\\'d at the freshness of her tall-borne face and full and\\n      pliant limbs,\\n  The more she look\\'d upon her she loved her,\\n  Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,\\n  She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace, she cook\\'d\\n      food for her,\\n  She had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and fondness.\\n\\n  The red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of the\\n      afternoon she went away,\\n  O my mother was loth to have her go away,\\n  All the week she thought of her, she watch\\'d for her many a month,\\n  She remember\\'d her many a winter and many a summer,\\n  But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.\\n\\n       7\\n  A show of the summer softness--a contact of something unseen--an\\n      amour of the light and air,\\n  I am jealous and overwhelm\\'d with friendliness,\\n  And will go

pleasure there is,\\n  Do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or\\n      planning a nomination and election? or with your wife and family?\\n  Or with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework? or the\\n      beautiful maternal cares?\\n  These also flow onward to others, you and I flow onward,\\n  But in due time you and I shall take less interest in them.\\n\\n  Your

well,\\n  The known leaders and inventors and the rich owners and pious and\\n      distinguish\\'d may be well,\\n  But there is more account than that, there is strict account of all.\\n\\n  The interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing,\\n  The barbarians of Africa and Asia are not nothing,\\n  The perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing as they go.\\n\\n  Of and in all these things,\\n  I have dream\\'d that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law of\\n      us changed,\\n  I have dream\\'d that heroes and good-doers shall be under the

think I could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward annihilation?\\n\\n  Pleasantly and well-suited I walk,\\n  Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is good,\\n  The whole universe indicates that it is good,\\n  The past and the present indicate that it is good.\\n\\n  How beautiful and perfect are the animals!\\n  How perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it!\\n  What is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just as perfect,\\n  The vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the imponderable\\n      fluids perfect;\\n  Slowly and surely they have pass\\'d on to this, and slowly and surely\\n      they yet pass on.\\n\\n       9\\n  I swear I think now that every thing without exception has an eternal soul!\\n  The trees have, rooted in the ground! the weeds

Shall I not escape?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs If a Phantom Caress\\'d Me\\n\\n  As if a phantom caress\\'d me,\\n  I thought I was not alone walking here by the shore;\\n  But the one I thought was with me as now I walk by the shore, the\\n      one I loved that caress\\'d me,\\n  As I lean and look through the glimmering light, that one has\\n      utterly disappear\\'d.\\n  And those appear that are hateful to me and mock me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssurances\\n\\n  I need no assurances, I am a man who is preoccupied of his own soul;\\n  I do not doubt that from under the feet and beside the hands and\\n      face I am cognizant of, are now looking faces I am not cognizant\\n      of, calm and actual faces,\\n  I do not doubt but the majesty and beauty of the world are latent in\\n      any iota of the world,\\n  I do not doubt I am limitless, and that the universes are limitless,\\n      in vain I try to think how limitless,\\n  I do not doubt that the orbs and the systems of orbs play their\\n      swift sports through the air on purpose, and that I shall one day\\n      be eligible to do as much as they, and more than they,\\n  I do not doubt that temporary affairs keep on and on millions of years,\\n  I do not doubt interiors have their interiors, and exteriors have\\n      their exteriors, and that the eyesight has another eyesight, and\\n      the hearing another hearing, and the voice another voice,\\n  I do not doubt that the passionately-wept deaths of young men are\\n      provided for, and that the deaths of young women and the\\n      deaths of little children are provided for,\\n  (Did you think Life was so well provided for, and Death, the purport\\n      of all Life, is not well provided for?)\\n  I do not doubt that wrecks at sea, no matter what the horrors of\\n      them, no matter whose wife, child, husband, father, lover, has\\n      gone down, are provided for, to the minutest points,\\n  I do not doubt that whatever can possibly happen anywhere at any\\n      time, is provided for in the inherences of things,\\n  I do not think Life provides for all and for Time and Space, but I\\n      believe Heavenly Death provides for all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuicksand Years\\n\\n  Quicksand years that whirl me I know not whither,\\n  Your schemes, politics, fail, lines give way, substances mock and elude me,\\n  Only the theme I sing, the great and strong-possess\\'d soul, eludes not,\\n  One\\'s-self must never give way--that is the final substance--that\\n      out of all is sure,\\n  Out of politics, triumphs, battles, life, what at last finally remains?\\n  When shows break up what but One\\'s-Self is sure?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat Music Always Round Me\\n\\n  That music always round me, unceasing, unbeginning, yet long\\n      untaught I did not hear,\\n  But now the chorus I hear and am elated,\\n  A tenor, strong, ascending with power and health, with glad notes of\\n      daybreak I hear,\\n  A soprano at intervals sailing buoyantly over the tops of immense waves,\\n  A transparent base shuddering lusciously under and through the universe,\\n  The triumphant tutti, the funeral wailings with sweet flutes and\\n      violins, all these I fill myself with,\\n  I hear not the volumes of sound merely, I am moved by the exquisite\\n      meanings,\\n  I listen to the different voices winding in and out, striving,\\n      contending with fiery vehemence to excel each other in emotion;\\n  I do not think the performers know themselves--but now I think\\n      begin to know them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Ship Puzzled at Sea\\n\\n  What ship puzzled at sea, cons for the true reckoning?\\n  Or coming in, to avoid the bars and follow the channel a perfect\\n      pilot needs?\\n  Here, sailor! here, ship! take aboard the most perfect pilot,\\n  Whom, in a little boat, putting off and rowing, I hailing you offer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA Noiseless Patient Spider\\n\\n  A noiseless patient spider,\\n  I mark\\'d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\\n  Mark\\'d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\\n  It launch\\'d forth filament, filament, filament out of itself,\\n  Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\\n\\n  And you O my soul where you stand,\\n  Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\\n  Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to\\n      connect them,\\n  Till the bridge you will need be form\\'d, till the ductile anchor hold,\\n  Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nO Living Always, Always Dying\\n\\n  O living always, always dying!\\n  O the burials of me past and present,\\n  O me while I stride ahead, material, visible, imperious as ever;\\n  O me, what I was for years, now dead, (I lament not, I am content;)\\n  O to disengage myself from those corpses of me, which I turn and\\n      look at where I cast them,\\n  To pass on, (O living! always living!) and leave the corpses behind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo One Shortly to Die\\n\\n  From all the rest I single out you, having a message for you,\\n  You are to die--let others tell you what they please, I cannot prevaricate,\\n  I am exact and merciless, but I love you--there is no escape for you.\\n\\n  Softly I lay my right hand upon you, you \\'ust feel it,\\n  I do not argue, I bend my head close and half envelop it,\\n  I sit quietly by, I remain faithful,\\n  I am more than nurse, more than parent or neighbor,\\n  I absolve you from all except yourself spiritual bodily, that is\\n      eternal, you yourself will surely escape,\\n  The corpse you will leave will be but excrementitious.\\n\\n  The sun bursts through in unlooked-for directions,\\n  Strong thoughts fill you and confidence, you smile,\\n  You forget you are sick, as I forget you are sick,\\n  You do not see the medicines, you do not mind the weeping friends,\\n      I am with you,\\n  I exclude others from you, there is nothing to be commiserated,\\n  I do not commiserate, I congratulate you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNight on the Prairies\\n\\n  Night on the prairies,\\n  The supper is over, the fire on the ground burns low,\\n  The wearied emigrants sleep, wrapt in their blankets;\\n  I walk by myself--I stand and look at the stars, which I think now\\n      never realized before.\\n\\n  Now I absorb immortality and peace,\\n  I admire death and test propositions.\\n\\n  How plenteous! how spiritual! how resume!\\n  The same old man and soul--the same old aspirations, and the same content.\\n\\n  I was thinking the day most splendid till I saw what the not-day exhibited,\\n  I was thinking this globe enough till there sprang out so noiseless\\n      around me myriads of other globes.\\n\\n  Now while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me I will\\n      measure myself by them,\\n  And now touch\\'d with the lives of other globes arrived as far along\\n      as those of the earth,\\n  Or waiting to arrive, or pass\\'d on farther than those of the earth,\\n  I henceforth no more ignore them than I ignore my own life,\\n  Or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine, or waiting to arrive.\\n\\n  O I see now that life cannot exhibit all to me, as the day cannot,\\n  I see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThought\\n\\n  As I sit with others at a great feast, suddenly while the music is playing,\\n  To my mind, (whence it comes I know not,) spectral in mist of a\\n      wreck at sea,\\n  Of certain ships, how they sail from port with flying streamers and\\n      wafted kisses, and that is the last of them,\\n  Of the solemn and murky mystery about the fate of the President,\\n  Of the flower of the marine science of fifty generations founder\\'d\\n      off the Northeast coast and going down--of the steamship Arctic\\n      going down,\\n  Of the veil\\'d tableau-women gather\\'d together on deck, pale, heroic,\\n      waiting the moment that draws so close--O the moment!\\n\\n  A huge sob--a few bubbles--the white foam spirting up--and then the\\n      women gone,\\n  Sinking there while the passionless wet flows on--and I now\\n      pondering, Are those women indeed gone?\\n  Are souls drown\\'d and destroy\\'d so?\\n  Is only matter triumphant?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Last Invocation\\n\\n  At the last, tenderly,\\n  From the walls of the powerful fortress\\'d house,\\n  From the clasp of the knitted locks, from the keep of the well-closed doors,\\n  Let me be wafted.\\n\\n  Let me glide noiselessly forth;\\n  With the key of softness

     parturitions,\\n  How America illustrates birth, muscular youth, the promise, the sure\\n      fulfilment, the absolute success, despite of people--illustrates\\n      evil as well as good,\\n  The vehement struggle so fierce for unity in one\\'s-self,\\n  How many hold despairingly yet to the models departed, caste, myths,\\n      obedience, compulsion, and to infidelity,\\n  How few see the arrived models, the athletes, the Western States, or\\n      see freedom or spirituality, or hold any faith in results,\\n  (But I see the athletes, and I see the results of the war glorious\\n      and inevitable, and they again leading to other results.)\\n\\n  How the great cities appear--how the Democratic masses, turbulent,\\n      willful, as I love them,\\n  How the whirl, the contest, the wrestle of evil with good, the\\n      sounding and resounding, keep on and on,\\n  How society waits unform\\'d, and is for a while between things ended\\n      and things begun,\\n  How America is the continent of glories, and of the triumph of\\n      freedom and of the Democracies, and of the fruits of society, and\\n      of all that is begun,\\n  And how the States are complete in themselves--and how all triumphs\\n      and glories are complete in themselves, to lead onward,\\n  And how these of mine and of the States will in their turn be\\n      convuls\\'d, and serve other parturitions and transitions,\\n  And how all people, sights, combinations, the democratic masses too,\\n      serve--and how every fact, and war itself, with all its horrors,\\n      serves,\\n  And how now or at any time each serves the exquisite transition of death.\\n\\n       2\\n  Of seeds dropping into the ground, of births,\\n  Of the steady concentration of America, inland, upward, to\\n      impregnable and swarming places,\\n  Of what Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, and the rest, are to be,\\n  Of what a few years will show there in Nebraska, Colorado, Nevada,\\n      and the rest,\\n  (Or afar, mounting the Northern Pacific to Sitka or Aliaska,)\\n  Of what the feuillage of America is the preparation for--and of what\\n      all sights, North, South, East and West, are,\\n  Of this Union welded in blood, of the solemn price paid, of the\\n      unnamed lost ever present in my mind;\\n  Of the temporary use of materials for identity\\'s sake,\\n  Of the present, passing, departing--of the growth of completer men\\n      than any yet,\\n  Of all sloping down there where the fresh free giver the mother, the\\n      Mississippi flows,\\n  Of mighty inland cities yet unsurvey\\'d and unsuspected,\\n  Of the new and good names, of the modern developments, of\\n      inalienable homesteads,\\n  Of a free and original life there, of simple diet and clean and\\n      sweet blood,\\n  Of litheness, majestic faces, clear eyes, and perfect physique there,\\n  Of immense spiritual results future years far West, each side of the\\n      Anahuacs,\\n  Of these songs, well understood there, (being made for that area,)\\n  Of the native scorn of grossness and gain there,\\n  (O it lurks in me night and day--what is gain after all to savageness\\n      and freedom?)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSong at Sunset\\n\\n  Splendor of ended day floating and filling me,\\n  Hour prophetic, hour resuming the past,\\n  Inflating my throat, you divine average,\\n  You earth and
