    "The processing and analysis of [natural languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language) is a core requirement for extracting structured information from spoken, signed, or written language and for feeding that information into systems or processes that generate insights from, or responses to provided language data. As languages that are naturally evolved and not designed for a specific purpose natural languages pose significant challenges when developing automated systems. \n",

    "Natural Language Processing - the class of activities in which language analysis, interpretation, and generation play key roles - is used in many disciplines as is demonstrated by this random sample of recent papers using NLP to address very different research problems:\n",
